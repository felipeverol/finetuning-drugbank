CYP2D6\\*1\n      is considered the wild-type allele associated with normal enzyme activity and the \"extensive\n      metabolizer\" phenotype; 90-95% of Caucasians are considered \"extensive metabolizers\" (with\n      normal CYP2D6 function) while the remaining 5-10% are considered \"poor metabolizers\" with\n      reduced or non-functioning enzyme.[A182294] CYP2D6 alleles associated with non-functioning\n      enzyme include *3, *4, *5, and *6 while alleles associated with reduced activity include *9,\n      *10, *17, and *41.[A183812]\n\n      Poor metabolizers have reduced activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme and therefore less production of\n      tramadol metabolites M1 and M2, which ultimately results in a reduced analgesic effect as\n      tramadol interacts with the μ-opioid receptor primarily via M1.[A4269]\n\n      There are also large differences in the frequency of these alleles between different\n      ethnicities: \\*3, \\*4, \\*5, \\*6, and \\*41 are more common among Caucasians while \\*17 is more\n      common in Africans for example.[A183812] Compared to 5-10% of Caucasians, only ~1% of Asians\n      are considered poor metabolizers, however Asian populations carry a much higher frequency\n      (51%) of the CYP2D6\\*10 allele, which is relatively rare in Caucasian populations and results\n      in higher exposure to tramadol.[A182294]\n\n      Some individuals are considered \"ultra-rapid metabolizers\", such as those carrying CYP2D6 gene\n      duplications (CYP2D6*DUP) or multiplications. These individuals are at risk of intoxication or\n      exaggerated effects of tramadol due to higher concentrations of its active metabolite\n      (M1).[A182297] The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in approximately 1% to 2% of East\n      Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% to 4% of African-Americans,\n      and may be >10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (ie, Oceanian, Northern African, Middle\n      Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). The FDA label recommends avoiding the use of tramadol\n      in these individuals.[L9257,F4679]"}]}

In animal studies, after oral dosing,\n      lovastatin had high selectivity for the liver, where it achieved substantially higher\n      concentrations than in non-target tissues. Lovastatin undergoes extensive first-pass\n      extraction in the liver, its primary site of action, with subsequent excretion of drug\n      equivalents in the bile. As a consequence of extensive hepatic extraction of lovastatin, the\n      availability of drug to the general circulation is low and variable. In a single dose study in\n      four hypercholesterolemic patients, it was estimated that less than 5% of an oral dose of\n      lovastatin reaches the general circulation as active inhibitors. Following administration of\n      lovastatin tablets the coefficient of variation, based on between-subject variability, was\n      approximately 40% for the area under the curve (AUC) of total inhibitory activity in the\n      general circulation.[F4661,F4664]\n\n      The peak concentrations of lovastatin when a dose of 10-40 mg is administered are reported to\n      range from 1.04-4.03 ng/ml and an AUC of 14-53 ng.h/ml. This indicates that lovastatin\n      presents a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile.[A174586] When lovastatin was given under\n      fasting conditions, plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were on average\n      about two-thirds those found when lovastatin was administered immediately after a standard\n      test meal.[F4664]\n\n      Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptide 1B1) hepatic\n      transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family\n      member 1B1) have been shown to impact lovastatin pharmacokinetics.[A181943] Evidence from\n      pharmacogenetic studies of the c.521T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showed that\n      lovastatin Cmax and AUC were 340 and 286% higher, respectively, for individuals homozygous for\n      521CC compared to homozygous 521TT individuals.[A181946] The 521CC genotype is also associated\n      with a marked increase in the risk of developing myopathy, likely secondary to increased\n      systemic exposure.[A181955] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include\n      [rosuvastatin], [pitavastatin], [atorvastatin], [simvastatin], and [pravastatin].[A181460]\n      While specific dosage instructions are not included in the available product monographs for\n      lovastatin, individuals with the above-mentioned c.521CC OATP1B1 genotype should be monitored\n      for development of adverse effects from increased exposure to the drug, such as muscle pain\n      and risk of rhabdomyolysis, particularly at higher doses."}]}

Concerta\n      also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.\n\n      Biphentin®: Methylphenidate is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration,\n      with peak blood levels obtained in 1-3 hours.[F4480]\n\n      When provided as Biphentin®, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release\n      delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is\n      provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate\n      doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time\n      profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect\n      for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD\n      impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the workday, etc).\n      Methylphenidate (immediate release): Methylphenidate hydrochloride is rapidly and extensively\n      absorbed from the tablets following oral administration; however, owing to extensive\n      first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is low (approx. 30%) and large individual differences\n      exist (11-52%). In one study, the administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride with food\n      accelerated absorption but had no effect on the amount absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations of\n      10.8 and 7.8 ng/mL were observed, on average, 2 hours after administration of 0.30 mg/kg in\n      children and adults, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations showed marked variability\n      between subjects. Both the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and the peak plasma\n      concentrations (Cmax) showed dose-proportionality.[F4483]"}]}

In psychiatric patients treated regularly\n      with haloperidol, the concentration of haloperidol glucuronide in plasma is the highest among\n      the metabolites, followed, in rank order, by unchanged haloperidol, reduced haloperidol and\n      reduced haloperidol glucuronide.\n\n      The drug is thought to be metabolized primarily by oxidative N-dealkylation of the piperidine\n      nitrogen to form fluorophenylcarbonic acids and piperidine metabolites (which appear to be\n      inactive), and by reduction of the butyrophenone carbonyl to the carbinol, forming\n      _hydroxyhaloperidol_.\n\n      The enzymes involved in the biotransformation of haloperidol include cytochrome P450 (CYP)\n      including CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, carbonyl reductase and uridine di-phosphoglucose\n      glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. The greatest proportion of the intrinsic hepatic clearance of\n      haloperidol is performed by glucuronidation and followed by the reduction of haloperidol to\n      reduced haloperidol and by CYP-mediated oxidation.\n\n      In studies of cytochrome-mediated disposition in vitro, CYP3A4 appears to be the major isoform\n      of the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of haloperidol in humans. The intrinsic clearance\n      of the back-oxidation of reduced haloperidol to the parent compound, oxidative N-dealkylation\n      and pyridinium formation are of the same order of magnitude. This suggests that the same\n      enzyme system is responsible for the above three metabolic reactions.\n\n      In vivo human studies on haloperidol metabolism have shown that the glucuronidation of\n      haloperidol accounts for 50 to 60% of haloperidol biotransformation and that approximately 23%\n      of the biotransformation was accounted for by the reduction pathway. The remaining 20 to 30%\n      ofthe biotransformation of haloperidol would be via N-dealkylation and pyridinium\n      formation.[A32346] "}]}

Relative to the fasting state, the plasma profile of inhibitors was not affected\n      when simvastatin was administered immediately before a test meal.[F4655,F4658]\n\n      In a pharmacokinetic study of 17 healthy Chinese volunteers, the major PK parameters were as\n      follows: Tmax 1.44 hours, Cmax 9.83 ug/L, t1/2 4.85 hours, and AUC 40.32ug·h/L.[A181571]\n      Simvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, the target organ for the\n      inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and the primary site of action. This tissue selectivity (and\n      consequent low systemic exposure) of orally administered simvastatin has been shown to be far\n      greater than that observed when the drug is administered as the enzymatically active form,\n      i.e. as the open hydroxyacid.[F4658]\n\n      In animal studies, after oral dosing, simvastatin achieved substantially higher concentrations\n      in the liver than in non-target tissues. However, because simvastatin undergoes extensive\n      first-pass metabolism, the bioavailability of the drug in the systemic system is low. In a\n      single-dose study in nine healthy subjects, it was estimated that less than 5% of an oral dose\n      of simvastatin reached the general circulation in the form of active inhibitors.[F4658]\n\n      Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptide 1B1) hepatic\n      transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family\n      member 1B1) have been shown to impact simvastatin pharmacokinetics.

In\n      terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role [F3178, F3181,\n      F3184]. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron,\n      it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency) will be\n      compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron\n      clearance [F3178, F3181, F3184].\n\n      Following oral or IV administration, ondansetron is extensively metabolised and excreted in\n      the urine and faeces [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In humans, less than 10% of the dose is excreted\n      unchanged in the urine [F3178, F3181, F3184]. The major urinary metabolites are glucuronide\n      conjugates (45%), sulphate conjugates (20%) and hydroxylation products (10%) [F3178, F3181,\n      F3184]. The primary metabolic pathway is subsequently hydroxylation on the indole ring\n      followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation [F3178, F3181, F3184].

Vitamin K is an important dietary component because it is necessary\n      as a cofactor in the activation of vitamin K dependent proteins. Metabolism of vitamin K\n      occurs mainly in the liver. In the first step, vitamin K is reduced to its quinone form by a\n      quinone reductase such as NADPH dehydrogenase. Reduced vitamin K is the form required to\n      convert vitamin K dependent protein precursors to their active states. It acts as a cofactor\n      to the integral membrane enzyme vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase (along with water and\n      carbon dioxide as co-substrates), which carboxylates glutamyl residues to\n      gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues on certain proteins, activating them.

To end the cycle, the vitamin K epoxide is returned\n      to vitamin K via the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme, also an integral membrane protein.\n      The vitamin K dependent proteins include various important coagulation factors, such as\n      prothrombin.

For example, the diacid and hydroxyl acid metabolites of PEG have\n      been measured in the plasma and urine of burn patients and rabbits and in the bile of cats. In\n      the isolated guinea pig liver and in rat/guinea pig in vitro, PEG has demonstrated to be\n      sulfated. Evidence from experiments with PEG400 suggests that ethylene glycol is not formed as\n      a metabolite of PEG in humans. Negligible amounts of oxalic acid are liberated after the\n      metabolism of PEG [L1790].\n\n      The first phase of metabolism of PEG in mammals is regulated by the enzyme alcohol\n      dehydrogenase. Liver cytochorome P450 enzymes may also play a role in the oxidation of PEG,\n      although the evidence for this is not clear [L1790]. Also, PEG has been shown to be\n      metabolized by sulfotransferase enzymes. Although there is evidence that PEG can be\n      metabolized to various phase 1 and phase 2 metabolites, the toxicology data presented above\n      indicate that these metabolites are of very little toxicological concern. However, metabolism\n      of PEG to the acid metabolite(s) has been implicated in the acidosis and hypercalcemia\n      observed in patients after overdose [L1790]. It is clear that these metabolites can be formed\n      in multiple toxicology species and that the phase 1 metabolites are seen in animals and\n      humans. These data indicate that humans and animals will be exposed to similar metabolites\n      after administration of PEG [L1790]. metabolic clearance of PEG decreases markedly as\n      molecular weight increases. For PEG400, up to 25% of the dose may be metabolized in humans\n      (Schaffer et al., 1950); similar results are also seen in the rabbit [L1790].\n\n      The absorption of PEG by the oral route is molecular weight- dependent. Urinary recovery data\n      for PEG400 indicate that 50 to 60% of PEG with this molecular weight is absorbed from the\n      intestine [L1790]. In the case of PEG-400, up to 25% of the dose may be metabolized in humans.\n      Similar results have also been obtained in studies on the rabbit [L1790]."}]}

Iron is mostly absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum [L2258]. Fe3+ displays low\n      solubility at the neutral pH of the intestine and is mainly be converted to ferrous iron\n      (Fe2+) by ferric reductases [T28], as ferric salts are only half as well absorbed as ferrous\n      salts [L2258]. Once converted in the intestinal lumen, Fe+2 is transported across the apical\n      membrane of enterocytes [A32514]. The absorption rate of non-haem iron is 2-20% [A32514].\n      Stored iron may be liberated via ferroportin-mediated efflux, which is coupled by reoxidation\n      of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by ceruloplasmin in the serum or hephaestin in the enterocyte membrane\n      [A32524]. Fe3+ subsequently binds to transferrin, which keeps ferric cation in a redox-inert\n      state and delivers it into tissues [A32514].\n\n      It is proposed that there may be separate cellular uptake pathways for ferrous iron and ferric\n      iron. While ferrous iron is primarily carried by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMAT-1),\n      cellular uptake of ferric iron is predominantly mediated by beta-3 integrin and mobilferrin,\n      which is also referred to as calreticulin in some sources as a homologue [A32507].

Next, peroxisome ω-oxidation results in\n      13’-carboxychromanol (13’-COOH) [A32451]. Following these two steps are five consecutive\n      β-oxidation reactions which serve to shorten the alpha-tocopherol metabolite side-chains\n      [A32451]. The first of these β-oxidations occurs still in the peroxisome environment,\n      generating carboxydimethyldecylhydroxychromanol (CDMDHC, 11’-COOH) [A32451]. Then, in the\n      mitochondrion, the second β-oxidation step forms the carboxymethyloctylhydroxychromanol\n      (CDMOHC, 9’-COOH) metabolite [A32451]. Since both CDMDHC and CDMOHC possess a side-chain\n      length of between 13 to 9 carbon units, they are considered long-chain metabolites. The\n      hydrophobicity of these long-chain metabolites means they are not excreted in the urine but\n      have been found in human microsomes, serum, and feces [A32451].

Both of these intermediate chain\n      metabolites are found in human plasma, feces, and urine [A32451]. Finally, the last\n      mitochrondrion β-oxidation generates the catabolic end product of alpha-tocopherol metabolism:\n      carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans (CEHC, 3'-COOH), which is considered a short-chain metabolite\n      [A32451].

It is known that vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that follows\n      the intestinal absorption, hepatic metabolism, and cellular uptake processes of other\n      lipophilic molecules and lipids [A32451]. The intestinal absorption of vitamin E consequently\n      requires the presence of lipid-rich foods [A32451].\n\n      In particular, stable alpha-tocopherol acetate undergoes hydrolysis by bile acid-dependant\n      lipase in the pancreas or by an intestinal mucosal esterase [A32451]. Subsequent absorption in\n      the duodenum occurs by way of transfer from emulsion fat globules to water-soluble multi- and\n      unilamellar vesicles and mixed micelles made up of phospholipids and bile acids [A32451]. As\n      the uptake of vitamin E into enterocytes is less efficient compared to other types of lipids,\n      this could potentially explain the relatively low bioavailability of vitamin E [A32451].\n      Alpha-tocopherol acetate itself is embedded in matrices where its hydrolysis and its uptake by\n      intestinal cells are markedly less efficient than in mixed micelles [A32451]. Subsequently,\n      the intestinal cellular uptake of vitamin E from mixed micelles follows in principle two\n      different pathways across enterocytes: (a) via passive diffusion, and (b) via\n      receptor-mediated transport with various cellular transports like scavenger receptor class B\n      type 1, Niemann-Pick C1-like protein, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5/ABCG8, or\n      ABCA1, among others [A32451].\n\n      Vitamin E absorption from the intestinal lumen is dependent upon biliary and pancreatic\n      secretions, micelle formation, uptake into enterocytes, and chylomicron secretion [T166].\n      Defects at any step can lead to impaired absorption. [T166]. Chylomicron secretion is required\n      for vitamin E absorption and is a particularly important factor for efficient absorption. All\n      of the various vitamin E forms show similar apparent efficiencies of intestinal absorption and\n      subsequent secretion in chylomicrons [T166]. During chylomicron catabolism, some vitamin E is\n      distributed to all the circulating lipoproteins [T166].\n\n      Chylomicron remnants, containing newly absorbed vitamin E, are then taken up by the liver\n      [T166]. Vitamin E is secreted from the liver in very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Plasma\n      vitamin E concentrations depend upon the secretion of vitamin E from the liver, and only one\n      form of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, is ever preferentially resecreted by the liver [T166].\n      The liver is consequently responsible for discriminating between tocopherols and the\n      preferential plasma enrichment with alpha-tocopherol [T166]. In the liver, the\n      alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) likely is in charge of the discriminatory\n      function, where RRR- or d-alpha-tocopherol possesses the greatest affinity for alpha-TTP\n      [T166].\n\n      It is nevertheless believed that only a small amount of administered vitamin E is actually\n      absorbed. In two individuals with gastric carcinoma and lymphatic leukemia, the respective\n      fractional absorption in the lymphatics was only 21 and 29 percent of label from meals\n      containing alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl acetate, respectively [T166].\n\n      Additionally, after feeding three separate single doses of 125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg to a\n      group of healthy males, the observed plasma peak concentrations (ng/mL) were 1822 +/- 48.24,\n      1931.00 +/- 92.54, and 2188 +/- 147.61, respectively [L2268]."}]}
