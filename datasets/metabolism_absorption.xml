    <name>Lepirudin</name>
    <metabolism>As a polypeptide, lepirudin is expected to be metabolized by the sequential cleavage
      of amino acids by kidney exoproteases, which have carboxypeptidase and dipeptidase-like
      activity.[L41539,L41544] The C-terminal cleavage of lepirudin aminoacids (aminoacids 1 to 65)
      produces four metabolites with anti-thrombotic activity: M1 (aminoacids 1 to 64), M2
      (aminoacids 1 to 63), M3 (aminoacids 1 to 62), and M4 (aminoacids 1 to 61).[L41544]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Lepirudin administered as a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.4 mg/kg in 9
      healthy volunteers (male and female) resulted in a C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 2924 ng/mL,
      a t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.17 h and an AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-∞&lt;/sub&gt; of 2500
      ng•h/mL.[L41539] When 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mg/kg of lepirudin was administered as a single
      intravenous infusion over 6 hours in healthy male volunteers, lepirudin had a corresponding
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 111, 203, and 2446 ng/mL and a corresponding AUC of 612, 1184,
      and 1446 ng•h/mL.[L41544] Bioavailability is 100% following injection. Also, it has been
      reported that following subcutaneous (sc) administration, the bioavailability of lepirudin is
      almost 100%.[A246609]</absorption>

    <name>Cetuximab</name>
    <metabolism>Like other monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab is expected to undergo lysosomal
      degradation by the reticuloendothelial system and protein catabolism by a target‐mediated
      disposition pathway.[A40006]</metabolism>
    <absorption>After administration of a 400 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; initial dose followed by
      a 250 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weekly dose, the steady-state levels of cetuximab was
      reached by the third weekly infusion with mean peak and trough concentrations across studies
      ranging from 168 µg/mL to 235 µg/mL and 41 µg/mL to 85 µg/mL, respectively.[L30448]

    <name>Dornase alfa</name>
    <metabolism>While no conclusive studies have yet been published, dornase alfa is expected to be
      metabolized by proteases in biofluids. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Studies in rats and monkeys after inhalation of dornase alfa shows very little
      systemic absorption (less than 15% for rats and less than 2% for monkeys). The results were
      also witnessed in patients. Dornase alfa is also associated with very low accumulation with no
      serum concentration greater than 10ng/mL observed no matter the dose administered.
      Bioavailability: mean sputum concentrations of dornase alfa can be measured after 15 minutes.
      Onset is achieved within 3 to 7 days. Peak concentrations are achieved after 9 days.</absorption>

      proteinases similarly to endogenous proteins.</metabolism>
    <absorption>Population pharmacokinetic modeling in adults with RA, AS, or who were healthy
      showed a subcutaneous bioavailability of 56.9% with a Ka of 0.0223/h.[A215352] Another model
      in pediatric JIA patients showed an increased Ka of 0.05/h with a high mean interindividual
      variability of 215%.[A215357] Cmax after a single 25 mg subcutaneous dose of Enbrel is
      reported as 1.1 mcg/L with a Tmax of 69 h.[L14862] Cmax after repeated dosing is reported as
      2.4 mcg/L in adult RA patients with a dosage of 25 mg twice weekly and 2.1 mcg in pediatric

    <name>Leuprolide</name>
    <metabolism>Radiolabeling studies suggest that leuprolide is primarily metabolized to inactive
      penta-, tri-, and dipeptide entities, which are likely further metabolized. It is expected
      that various peptidases encountered throughout systemic circulation are responsible for
      leuprolide metabolism.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Leuprolide is typically administered as a single-dose long-acting formulation
      employing either microsphere or biodegradable solid depot technologies.[A203126] Regardless of
      the exact formulation and initial dose strength, the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is typically
      achieved by 4-5 hours post-injection and displays large variability in the range of 4.6 - 212
      ng/mL. Eventual steady-state kinetics are typically achieved by four weeks, with a narrower
      range of 0.1 - 2 ng/mL. No studies on the effects of food on absorption have been carried
      out.[L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814, L34415]</absorption>

    <name>Alteplase</name>
    <metabolism>Alteplase is mainly metabolized by the liver. The carbohydrate and polypeptide
      domains of alteplase interact with hepatic glycoprotein receptors, leading to
      receptor-mediated endocytosis.[A252270] _In vivo_ studies suggest that alteplase follows
      zero-order kinetics, meaning that its metabolism is saturable at higher plasma
      concentrations.[A252270]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Healthy volunteers with a baseline endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) of
      3.3 ng/ml had a 290-fold increase in baseline concentrations after receiving alteplase at an
      infusion rate of 0.25 mg/kg for 30 min; with an infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg, a 550-fold
      increase was observed.[A252270] Acute myocardial infarction patients (n=12) given 10 mg of
      alteplase in a 2-minute infusion reached a peak plasma concentration of 3310 ng/ml. This was
      followed by 50 mg of alteplase in 1 h and 30 mg in 1.5 h, resulting in steady-state plasma
      levels of 2210 ng/ml and 930 ng/ml, respectively.[A252285]</absorption>

  <drug type="biotech" created="2005-06-13" updated="2023-01-03">
    <name>Erythropoietin</name>
    <metabolism>Binding of erythropoietin and epoetin alfa to EPO-R leads to cellular
      internalization, which involves the degradation of the ligand. Erythropoietin and epoetin alfa
      may also be degraded by the reticuloendothelial scavenging pathway or lymphatic system
      [A33080].</metabolism>
    <absorption>The time to reach peak concentration is slower via the subcutaneous route than the
      intravenous route which ranges from 20 to 25 hours, and the peak is always well below the peak
      achieved using the intravenous route (5–10% of those seen with IV administration).[A33080] The
      bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable erythropoietin is much lower than that of the
      intravenously administered product and is approximately 20-40%.[A33080]

      **Adult and paediatric patients with CRF:** Following subcutaneous administration, the peak
      plasma levels are achieved within 5 to 24 hours [FDA Label].

      **Cancer patients receiving cyclic chemotherapy:** The average time to reach peak plasma
      concentration was approximately 13.3 ± 12.4 hours after 150 Units/kg three times per week
      (TIW) subcutaneous (SC) dosing. The Cmax is expected be 3- to 7- fold higher and the Tmax is
      expected to be 2- to 3-fold longer in patients receiving a 40,000 Units SC weekly dosing
      regimen [FDA Label]. </absorption>

    <metabolism>Salmon calcitonin primarily undergoes degradation in the kidneys to form
      pharmacologically inactive metabolites. It is also metabolized in the blood and the peripheral
      tissue. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Salmon calcitonin is rapidly absorbed with bioavailability of 71% following

  <drug type="biotech" created="2005-06-13" updated="2022-12-06">
    <name>Pegfilgrastim</name>
    <metabolism>It is not know whether pegfilgrastim is metabolized into major metabolites.[L10022]
      Once it binds to the therapeutic target, pegfilgrastim is internalized by the neutrophil and
      undergoes nonspecific degradation.[A29]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Pegfilgrastim has a lower absolute bioavailability than filgrastim following
      subcutaneous administration. The absorption of pegfilgrastim is largely dependent on the
      lymphatic system due to the attached PEG group contributing to the large size of the drug. It
      is slowly absorbed following subcutaneous administration with a time to peak concentration
      (T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of about one to two days.[A29]</absorption>

    <absorption>The bioavailability of anakinra is 95% in healthy subjects administered a 70 mg
      subcutaneous bolus injection. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) administered a
      subcutaneous dose of anakinra, the maximum plasma concentration was detected 3 to 7 hours
      later. No unexpected accumulation was observed in RA patients receiving this drug for up to 24
      weeks.[L35415] In a phase 1, single-center, randomized, sequential single-dose escalation PK
      study done in patients with stable RA, AUC increased in a relatively dose-proportional manner.
      While the t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuated across the
      different doses provided to these patients (range from 0.5 to 6 mg/kg), clearance appeared to
      be consistent.[L41628] In patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease
      (NOMID) treated with a subcutaneous dose of 3 mg/kg of anakinra for an average of 3.5 years
      (n=16), C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 3628 ng/mL and C&lt;sub&gt;24h&lt;/sub&gt; was 203

    <metabolism>The metabolism and elimination of orally inhaled human insulin are comparable to
      regular human insulin.</metabolism>
    <absorption>When injected subcutaneously, the glucose-lowering effect of human insulin begins
      approximately 30 minutes post-dose. After a single subcutaneous administration of 0.1 unit/kg
      of human insulin to healthy subjects, peak insulin concentrations occurred between 1.5 to 2.5
      hours post-dose.

      When administered in an inhaled form (as the product Afrezza), the time to maximum serum
      insulin concentration ranges from 10-20 minutes after oral inhalation of 4 to 48 units of
      human insulin. Serum insulin concentrations declined to baseline by approximately 60-240
      minutes for these dose levels. Intrapatient variability in insulin exposure measured by AUC
      and Cmax is approximately 16% (95% CI 12-23%) and 21% (95% CI 16-30%), respectively.</absorption>

    <name>Omalizumab</name>
    <metabolism>Monoclonal antibodies, in general, are believed to be internalized in endothelial
      cells bound to the Fc receptor and rescued from metabolism by recycling. At a later time, they
      are degraded in the reticuloendothelial system to smaller peptides and amino acids, which can
      then be used for de-novo protein synthesis [A31470]. Several factors may influence this
      process, however. These include factors related to the target antigen, antibody, and patient
      [A31470].

      The metabolism of omalizumab is determined by its IgG1 framework, and by its specific binding
      to IgE. The elimination of omalizumab is dose-dependent. The reticuloendothelial system and
      the liver are two sites of elimination for IgG (including degradation in the liver
      reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells) [F1946], [A31470]. The omalizumab:IgE
      complexes are thought to be to cleared via interactions with Fc- gamma-Rs (Fc gamma RI, Fc
      gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII) at rates that are more rapid than that of IgG clearance. The
      relative clearance of free omalizumab, free IgE, and complexes is summarized as: free IgE
      clearance &gt; &gt; omalizumab:IgE clearance &gt; omalizumab clearance [F1946].

    </metabolism>
    <absorption>After subcutaneous administration in pharmacokinetic studies, omalizumab was
      absorbed with a mean absolute bioavailability of 62% [FDA label]. After the administration of
      a single subcutanous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, omalizumab was
      absorbed slowly. The peak serum concentrations peaked after an average of 7­-8 days. In
      patients with CIU, the peak serum concentration was reached at a similar time after a single
      SC dose. The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab was linear at doses which were higher than 0.5
      mg/kg. In patients with asthma, after several doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum
      concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after
      one dose. In patients with CIU, omalizumab showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of
      75 mg to 600 mg administered as a single subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing from
      75mg-300 mg every 4 weeks, trough serum concentrations of omalizumab increased proportionally
      with the dose [FDA label].</absorption>

      injection in healthy subjects. Absorption also differs depending on the site of injection.
      After insulin lispro was administered in the abdomen, serum drug levels were higher and the

    <name>Insulin glargine</name>
    <metabolism>Insulin glargine is metabolized in the liver into two active metabolites with
      similar activity to insulin: 21a-Gly-human insulin (M1) and 21a-Gly-des-30b- threonine insulin
      (M2), with M1 being the predominant metabolite.</metabolism>
    <absorption>Because of the modifications to the A and B chain, the isoelectric point shifts
      towards a neutral pH and insulin glargine is more stable in acidic conditions than regular
      insulin. As insulin glargine is less soluble at neutral pH, once injected, forms
      microprecipitates. Slow release of insulin glargine from microprecipitates provides a
      relatively constant concentration of insulin over 24 hours. Onset of action is approximately
      1.1 hours.

      The pharmacokinetic profiles for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of Toujeo in 24 patients

      Patients with severe renal impairment and those on dialysis had mean steady-state AUC values

    <name>Oxytocin</name>
    <metabolism>Oxytocin is rapidly removed from the plasma by the liver and kidney.[L31433] The
      enzyme oxytocinase is largely responsible for the metabolism and regulation of oxytocin levels
      in pregnancy and only a small percentage of the neurohormone is excreted in the urine
      unchanged.[L31433,L31788] Oxytocinase activity increases throughout pregnancy and peaks in the
      plasma, placenta and uterus near term.[L31788] The placenta is a key source of oxytocinase
      during gestation and produces increasing amounts of the enzyme in response to increasing
      levels of oxytocin produced by the mother.[A229058,A229063] Oxytocinase activity is also
      expressed in mammary glands, heart, kidney, and the small intestine.[A228593] Lower levels of
      activity can be found in the brain, spleen, liver, skeletal muscle, testes, and
      colon.[A228593] The level of oxytocin degradation is negligible in non-pregnant women, men,
      and cord blood.[L31788]</metabolism>

    <name>Bevacizumab</name>
    <metabolism>There are several pathways through which monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may be
      cleared.[A192948] Non-specific clearance of mAbs refers to target independent pinocytosis, and
      proteolysis of the protein into small amino acids and peptides in the reticuloendothelial
      system (RES) and the liver.[A192948,A40006] Target-mediated clearance is a result of specific
      interactions between the mAb and its target antigen.[A192948] Once bound, the antibody-antigen
      complex may be cleared via lysosomal degradation.[A192948,A40006] Additionally, the production
      of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), which are a result of an immunogenic response to mAb-based
      treatment, can form complexes with mAb’s and may impact the rate of mAb clearance.[A192948]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are large in size, do not readily cross cell membranes,
      and are unable to withstand proteolysis in the gastrointestinal tract.[A40006,A192981,A19126]
      Given these characteristics, mAbs are poorly absorbed via the oral route and are instead
      administered intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously.[A40006,A19126]

    <name>Cyanocobalamin</name>
    <metabolism>Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin obtained from food is initially bound by
      _haptocorrin_, a protein found in the saliva with high affinity for B12. This forms a
      _haptocorrin-B12_ complex. Cyanocobalamin passes through the stomach and is protected from
      acid degradation due to its binding to haptocorrin. In the duodenum, pancreatic _proteases_
      release cobalamin from the _haptocorrin-B12 complex_ and from other proteins containing
      protein-bound B12 that have been ingested. Following this, the binding of cobalamin to a
      second glycoprotein, _intrinsic factor_, promotes its uptake by terminal ileum mucosal cells
      by a process called _cubilin_/AMN receptor-mediated endocytosis. After absorption into
      enterocytes, intrinsic factor is broken down in the lysosome, and cobalamin is then released
      into the bloodstream. The transporter ABCC1, found in the basolateral membrane of intestinal
      epithelial and other cells, exports cobalamin bound to transcobalamin out of the cell
      [A175273]. Cyanocobalamin then passes through the portal vein in the liver, and then reaches
      the systemic circulation. The active forms of cyanocobalamin are _methylcobalamin_ and
      _adenosylcobalamin_ [A175273], [L2064]. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Vitamin B12 is quickly absorbed from intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) sites
      of injection; with peak plasma concentrations achieved about 1 hour after IM injection
      [F3736].

      Orally administered vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor (IF) during its transport through
      the stomach. The separation of Vitamin B12 and IF occurs in the terminal ileum when calcium is
      present, and vitamin B12 is then absorbed into the gastrointestinal mucosal cells. It is then
      transported by transcobalamin binding proteins [L5545]. Passive diffusion through the
      intestinal wall can occur, however, high doses of vitamin B12 are required in this case (i.e.
      &gt;1 mg). After the administration of oral doses less than 3 mcg, peak plasma concentrations
      are not reached for 8 to 12 hours, because the vitamin is temporarily retained in the wall of
      the lower ileum [F3736]. </absorption>

    <name>Calcitriol</name>
    <metabolism>Metabolism of calcitriol involves two pathways [FDA Label]. The first pathway
      involves 24-hydroxylase activity in the kidney; this enzyme is also present in many target
      tissues which possess the vitamin D receptor such as the intestine. The end product of this
      pathway is a side chain shortened metabolite, calcitroic acid. The second pathway involves the
      conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and
      cyclization to yield ultimately 1a,25R(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-26,23S-lactone D3, which
      appears to be the major metabolite circulating in humans.

      Ohter identified metabolites of calcitriol include 1α, 25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3; 1α,

    <absorption>Upon administration, calcitriol is rapidly absorbed from the intestines. When a

    <name>Ergocalciferol</name>
    <metabolism>Ergocalciferol is inactive and hence, the first step in the body is ruled by the
      conversion of this parent compound to 25-hydroxyvitamin D by the action of CYP2R1 followed by
      the generation of the major circulating metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or
      calcitrol.[T577] The generation of this major metabolite is ruled by the activity of CYP27B1
      which is a key 1-hydroxylase and CYP24A1 which is responsible for the
      25-hydroxylation.[A177637]

      As part of the minor metabolism, ergocalciferol is transformed into 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the
      liver by the activity of D-25-hydroxylase and CYP2R1. As well, the formation of
      24(R),25dihydroxyvitamin D is performed mainly in the kidneys by the action of
      25-(OH)D-1-hydroxylase and 25-(OH)D-24-hydroxylase.[T580]

      Additionally, there are reports indicating significant activity of 3-epimerase in the
      metabolism of ergocalciferol which modifies the hydroxy group in C3 from the alpha position to
      a beta. The epimers formed seemed to have a reduced affinity for the vitamin D plasma proteins
      and to the vitamin D receptor.[A177637]

      An alternative activation metabolic pathway has been reported and this process is
      characterized by the activity of CYP11A1 and its hydroxylation in the C-20. This
      20-hydroxylated vitamin D seems to have similar biological activity than calcitriol.[A177637]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Ergocalciferol is absorbed in the intestine and carried to the liver in

      which it is dissolved[L3063,A176104]. For patients with poor fat absorption, a water soluble
      form of vitamin E may need to be substituted such as tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000
      succinate[L3063].

      In other studies the oral bioavailability of alpha-tocopherol was 36%, gamma-tocotrienol was

    <name>Cholecalciferol</name>
    <metabolism>Within the liver, cholecalciferol is hydroxylated to calcifediol
      (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) by the enzyme vitamin D-25-hydroxylase [F4027, F4042, F4048]. At
      the kidney, calcifediol subsequently serves as a substrate for 1-alpha-hydroxylase, yielding
      calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D3 [F4027,
      F4042, F4048].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Cholecalciferol is readily absorbed from the small intestine if fat absorption is
      normal [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Moreover, bile is necessary for absorption as well [F4027,
      F4042, F4048].

      In particular, recent studies have determined aspects about the absorption of vitamin D, like
      the fact that a) the 25-hydroxyvitamin D metabolite of cholecalciferol is absorbed to a
      greater extent than the nonhydroxy form of cholecalciferol, b) the quantity of fat with which
      cholecalciferol is ingested does not appear to largely affect its bioavailability, and c) age
      does not apparently effect vitamin D cholecalciferol [A176447].</absorption>

    <name>Pravastatin</name>
    <metabolism>After initial administration, pravastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction
      in the liver.[A34502] However, pravastatin's metabolism is not related to the activity of the
      cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and its processing is performed in a minor extent in the liver.
      Therefore, this drug is highly exposed to peripheral tissues.[A177682]

      The metabolism of pravastatin is ruled mainly by the presence of glucuronidation reactions
      with very minimal intervention of CYP3A enzymes. After metabolism, pravastatin does not
      produce active metabolites.[A34502] This metabolism is mainly done in the stomach followed by
      a minor portion of renal and hepatic processing.[A39676]

      The major metabolite formed as part of pravastatin metabolism is the 3-alpha-hydroxy isomer.
      The activity of this metabolite is very clinically negligible.[F4603]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Pravastatin is absorbed 60-90 min after oral administration and it presents a low
      bioavailability of 17%.[A34502] This low bioavailability can be presented due to the polar
      nature of pravastatin which produces a high range of first-pass metabolism and incomplete
      absorption.[T239]

      Pravastatin is rapidly absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine via proton-coupled
      carrier-mediated transport to be later taken up in the livery by the sodium-independent bile
      acid transporter.[A39676] The reported time to reach the peak serum concentration in the range

      metabolites.[A174124,L40064] The primary metabolite, accounting for about 9% of dose, is
      valeryl 4-hydroxy valsartan. In vitro metabolism studies involving recombinant CYP 450 enzymes
      indicated that the CYP 2C9 isoenzyme is responsible for the formation of valeryl-4-hydroxy
      valsartan. Valsartan does not inhibit CYP 450 isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations.
      CYP 450 mediated drug interaction between valsartan and coadministered drugs are unlikely
      because of the low extent of metabolism.[L11305]</metabolism>
    <absorption>After one oral dose, the antihypertensive activity of valsartan begins within
      approximately 2 hours and peaks within 4-6 hours in most patients.[L40064] Food decreases the
      exposure to orally administered valsartan by approximately 40% and peak plasma concentration
      by approximately 50%. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan generally increase linearly with

    <name>Tramadol</name>
    <metabolism>Tramadol undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver by N- and O-
      demethylation and conjugation. From the extensive metabolism, there have been identified at
      least 23 metabolites. There are two main metabolic pathways: the O-demethylation of tramadol
      to produce O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) catalyzed by CYP2D6 and the N-demethylation to
      N-desmethyl-tramadol (M2) catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.[A4269,L9257,F4679]

      The wide variability in the pharmacokinetic properties between patients can partly be ascribed
      to polymorphisms within the gene for CYP2D6 that determine its enzymatic activity. CYP2D6\*1
      is considered the wild-type allele associated with normal enzyme activity and the "extensive
      metabolizer" phenotype; 90-95% of Caucasians are considered "extensive metabolizers" (with
      normal CYP2D6 function) while the remaining 5-10% are considered "poor metabolizers" with
      reduced or non-functioning enzyme.[A182294] CYP2D6 alleles associated with non-functioning
      enzyme include *3, *4, *5, and *6 while alleles associated with reduced activity include *9,
      *10, *17, and *41.[A183812]

      Poor metabolizers have reduced activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme and therefore less production of
      tramadol metabolites M1 and M2, which ultimately results in a reduced analgesic effect as
      tramadol interacts with the μ-opioid receptor primarily via M1.[A4269]

      There are also large differences in the frequency of these alleles between different
      ethnicities: \*3, \*4, \*5, \*6, and \*41 are more common among Caucasians while \*17 is more
      common in Africans for example.[A183812] Compared to 5-10% of Caucasians, only ~1% of Asians
      are considered poor metabolizers, however Asian populations carry a much higher frequency
      (51%) of the CYP2D6\*10 allele, which is relatively rare in Caucasian populations and results
      in higher exposure to tramadol.[A182294]

      Some individuals are considered "ultra-rapid metabolizers", such as those carrying CYP2D6 gene
      duplications (CYP2D6*DUP) or multiplications. These individuals are at risk of intoxication or
      exaggerated effects of tramadol due to higher concentrations of its active metabolite
      (M1).[A182297] The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in approximately 1% to 2% of East
      Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% to 4% of African-Americans,
      and may be &gt;10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (ie, Oceanian, Northern African, Middle
      Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). The FDA label recommends avoiding the use of tramadol
      in these individuals.[L9257,F4679]</metabolism>
    <absorption>**Oral Administration**

      Tramadol is administered as a racemate, with both the [-] and [+] forms of both tramadol and
      the M1 metabolite detected in circulation. Following administration, racemic tramadol is
      rapidly and almost completely absorbed, with a bioavailability of 75%. This difference in
      absorption and bioavailability can be attributed to the 20-30% first-pass metabolism. Peak
      plasma concentrations of tramadol and the primary metabolite M1 occur at two and three hours,
      respectively.[F4679] Following a single oral dose of 100mg of tramadol, the Cmax was found to
      be approximately 300μg/L with a Tmax of 1.6-1.9 hours, while metabolite M1 was found to have a
      Cmax of 55μg/L with a Tmax of 3 hours.[A4269,L9257]

      Steady-state plasma concentrations of both tramadol and M1 are achieved within two days of
      dosing. There is no evidence of self-induction.[F4679] Following multiple oral doses, Cmax is
      16% higher and AUC is 36% higher than after a single dose, demonstrating a potential role of
      saturable first-pass hepatic metabolism in increasing bioavailability.[A4269]

      **Intramuscular Administration**

      Tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following intramuscular administration.
      Following injection of 50mg of tramadol, Cmax of 166μg/L was found with a Tmax of 0.75
      hours.[A4269]

      **Rectal Administration**

      Following rectal administration with suppositories containing 100mg of tramadol, Cmax of
      294μg/L was found with a Tmax of 3.3 hours. The absolute bioavailability was found to be
      higher than oral administration (77% vs 75%), likely due to reduced first-pass metabolism with
      rectal administration compared to oral administration.[A4269]</absorption>

      CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.[L11034,L11043] Two metabolites were detected in the urine of
      healthy volunteers taking a 50 mg radiolabeled dose of fluconazole; a glucuronidated
      metabolite on the hydroxyl moiety (6.5%) and a fluconazole N-oxide metabolite (2%).[A178813]
      The same study indicated that no signs of metabolic cleavage of fluconazole were observed,
      suggesting a difference in metabolism when compared to other agents in the same drug class,
      which are heavily metabolized in the liver.[A178813,A178834]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The pharmacokinetic properties of fluconazole are comparable after administration by
      the intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) routes. In healthy volunteers, the bioavailability of
      orally administered fluconazole is measured to be above 90%.[L11043] It is extensively
      absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract when an oral dose is taken.[A178813] Oral absorption is
      not affected by food intake with fluconazole but may increase the time until the maximum
      concentration is reached.[L11034,A178792]

      Tmax (or the time taken to achieve the maximum concentration) in one clinical study of healthy
      patients receiving 50 mg/kg of fluconazole was 3 hours.[A178792]

      Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) in fasting and healthy volunteers occur between 1-2 hours
      post-dose.[L11043] Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 5 to 10 days after oral
      doses of 50-400 mg administered once daily. Administration of a loading dose on the first day
      of fluconazole treatment, or twice the usual daily dose, leads to plasma concentrations close
      to steady-state by the second day.[L11043] Mean AUC (area under the curve) was 20.3 in healthy
      volunteers receiving 25 mg of fluconazole.[A178792]

      **A note on the capsule and powder form and malabsorption syndromes**

      The capsule forms of fluconazole often contain lactose and should not be administered with
      hereditary galactose intolerance, _Lapp lactase enzyme_ deficiency, or malabsorption of
      glucose/galactose.[L11043] The powder form, used for the oral suspension, lists sucrose as an
      ingredient and should not be used in patients who have been diagnosed with fructose,
      glucose/galactose malabsorption, and _sucrase-isomaltase_ enzyme deficiency.[L11043]</absorption>

    <name>Oseltamivir</name>
    <metabolism>Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir
      carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not
      further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or
      inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms. No phase 2 conjugates of either compound have been
      identified in vivo.[F3094, F3097, L5161, F3115]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Oseltamivir is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral
      administration of oseltamivir phosphate and is extensively converted by predominantly hepatic
      esterases to the active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate. At least 75 % of an oral dose
      reaches the systemic circulation as the active metabolite. Exposure to the pro-drug is less
      than 5 % relative to the active metabolite. Plasma concentrations of both pro-drug and active
      metabolite are proportional to dose and are unaffected by co-administration with food.[F3094,
      F3097, L5161, F3115] Pharmacokinetic parameters following twice daily dosing of oseltamivir
      75mg capsules are as follows: Cmax of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate were found to be
      65ng/mL and 348ng/mL, respectively, while AUC (0-12h) of oseltamivir and oseltamivir
      carboxylate were found to be 112ng·h/mL and 2719ng·h/mL, respectively.[F3097]</absorption>

    <name>Erythromycin</name>
    <metabolism>Hepatic first-pass metabolism contributes significantly to erythromycin metabolism
      after an oral dose.[A174457] Erythromycin is partially metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme to
      N-desmethylerythromycin.[L7261,A174175] Erythromycin is also hydrolyzed to _anhydro_ forms
      (anhydroerythromycin [AHE] and other metabolites), and this process is promoted by acidic
      conditions.[A174448] AHE is inactive against microbes but inhibits hepatic drug oxidation and
      is therefore considered to be an important contributor to erythromycin drug-drug
      interactions.[A174448]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Orally administered erythromycin is readily absorbed. Food intake does not appear to
      exert effects on serum concentrations of erythromycin.[L7261] Some interindividual variation
      exists in terms of erythromycin absorption, which may impact absorption to varying
      degrees.[L7261] The Cmax of erythromycin is 1.8 mcg/L[A180598] and the Tmax is 1.2
      hours.[A180607] The serum AUC of erythromycin after the administration of a 500mg oral dose
      was 7.3±3.9 mg.h/l in one pharmacokinetic study.[A180607] Erythromycin is well known for a
      bioavailability that is variable (18-45%) [A174451,A180595] after oral administration and its
      susceptibility to broken down under acidic conditions.[A174448]</absorption>

    <name>Caffeine</name>
    <metabolism>Caffeine metabolism occurs mainly in the liver via the cytochrome CYP1A2
      enzyme.[A187730] The products of caffeine metabolism include paraxanthine, theobromine, and
      theophylline. The first step of caffeine metabolism is demethylation, yielding paraxanthine (a
      major metabolite), followed by theobromine, and theophylline, which are both minor
      metabolites. They are then excreted in urine as urates after additional
      metabolism.[A187730,T716,L9851] The enzymes xanthine oxidase and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2)
      also participate in the metabolism of caffeine.[A187730]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Caffeine is rapidly absorbed after oral or parenteral administration, reaching peak
      plasma concentration within 30 minutes to 2 hours after administration.[A187730] After oral
      administration, onset of action takes place within 45 to 1 hour.[L9827] Food may delay
      caffeine absorption. The peak plasma level for caffeine ranges from 6-10mg/L.[L9851] The
      absolute bioavailability is unavailable in neonates[L9851], but reaches about 100% in
      adults.[T716]</absorption>

    <name>Sildenafil</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of sildenafil is facilitated primarily by the CYP3A4 hepatic
      microsomal isoenzymes and to a minor extent, via the CYP2C9 hepatic isoenzymes [A175654,
      F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The predominant circulating
      metabolite results from the N-demethylation of sildenafil [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856,
      F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. This particular resultant metabolite possesses a
      phosphodiesterase selectivity that is similar to the parent sildenafil molecule and a
      corresponding in vitro potency for PDE5 that is approximately 50% that of the parent drug
      [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Moreover, plasma
      concentrations of the metabolite are about 40% of those recorded for sildenafil, a percentage
      that accounts for about 20% of sildenafil’s pharmacologic effects [A175654, F3850, F3853,
      F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. This primary N-desmethyl metabolite of sildenafil
      also undergoes further metabolism, with a terminal half-life of about 4 hours [A175654, F3850,
      F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

      In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, plasma concentrations of the primary
      N-desmethyl metabolite are about 72% those of the original parent sildenafil molecule after a
      regimen of 20 mg three times a day - which is consequently responsible for about a 36%
      contribution to sildenafil’s overall pharmacological effects [A175654, F3850, F3853, F3856,
      F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Sildenafil is known to be quickly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentrations being
      observed within 30-120 minutes (with a median of 60 minutes) of oral administration in a
      fasting patient [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Moreover, the mean
      absolute bioavailability observed for sildenafil is about 41% (from a range of 25-63%) [F3850,
      F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, after oral three times a day
      dosing of sildenafil, the AUC and Cmax increase in proportion with dose over the recommended
      dosage range of 25-100 mg [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

      When used in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, however, the oral bioavailability of
      sildenafil after a dosing regimen of 80 mg three times a day, was on average 43% greater than
      compared to the lower doses [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

      Finally, if sildenafil is administered orally with food, the rate of absorption is observed to
      be decreased with a mean delay in Tmax of about 60 minutes and a mean decrease in Cmax of
      approximately 29% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Regardless, the
      extent of absorption is not observed to be significantly affected as the recorded AUC
      decreased by only about 11 % [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].</absorption>

    <name>Lovastatin</name>
    <metabolism>Lovastatin is given as a lactone prodrug and thus, in order to produce its mechanism
      of action, it is required to be converted to the active beta-hydroxy form. This drug
      activation process does not seem to be related to CYP isoenzyme activity[A414] but rather to
      be controlled by the activity of serum paraoxonase.[A15320]

      Lovastatin is metabolized by the microsomal hepatic enzyme system (Cytochrome P-450 isoform
      3A4). The major active metabolites present in human plasma are the β-hydroxy acid of
      lovastatin, its 6'-hydroxy, 6'-hydroxymethyl, and 6'-exomethylene derivatives.[F4664] The
      uptake of lovastatin by the liver is enhanced by the activity of OATP1B1.[A35026] </metabolism>
    <absorption>Lovastatin Cmax was found to be 3.013ng/mL with a Tmax of 3.36 hours.[F4664]

      Plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (lovastatin plus 14C-metabolites) peaked at 2
      hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of peak by 24 hours postdose. Absorption of
      lovastatin, estimated relative to an intravenous reference dose, in each of four animal
      species tested, averaged about 30% of an oral dose. In animal studies, after oral dosing,
      lovastatin had high selectivity for the liver, where it achieved substantially higher
      concentrations than in non-target tissues. Lovastatin undergoes extensive first-pass
      extraction in the liver, its primary site of action, with subsequent excretion of drug
      equivalents in the bile. As a consequence of extensive hepatic extraction of lovastatin, the
      availability of drug to the general circulation is low and variable. In a single dose study in
      four hypercholesterolemic patients, it was estimated that less than 5% of an oral dose of
      lovastatin reaches the general circulation as active inhibitors. Following administration of
      lovastatin tablets the coefficient of variation, based on between-subject variability, was
      approximately 40% for the area under the curve (AUC) of total inhibitory activity in the
      general circulation.[F4661,F4664]

      The peak concentrations of lovastatin when a dose of 10-40 mg is administered are reported to
      range from 1.04-4.03 ng/ml and an AUC of 14-53 ng.h/ml. This indicates that lovastatin
      presents a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile.[A174586] When lovastatin was given under
      fasting conditions, plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were on average
      about two-thirds those found when lovastatin was administered immediately after a standard
      test meal.[F4664]

      Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptide 1B1) hepatic
      transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family
      member 1B1) have been shown to impact lovastatin pharmacokinetics.[A181943] Evidence from
      pharmacogenetic studies of the c.521T&gt;C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showed that
      lovastatin Cmax and AUC were 340 and 286% higher, respectively, for individuals homozygous for
      521CC compared to homozygous 521TT individuals.[A181946] The 521CC genotype is also associated
      with a marked increase in the risk of developing myopathy, likely secondary to increased
      systemic exposure.[A181955] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include
      [rosuvastatin], [pitavastatin], [atorvastatin], [simvastatin], and [pravastatin].[A181460]
      While specific dosage instructions are not included in the available product monographs for
      lovastatin, individuals with the above-mentioned c.521CC OATP1B1 genotype should be monitored
      for development of adverse effects from increased exposure to the drug, such as muscle pain
      and risk of rhabdomyolysis, particularly at higher doses.</absorption>

      Food decreases the rate of pregabalin absorption and as a result, lowers the Cmax by an
      estimated 25-30% and increases the Tmax to approximately 3 hours.[L7066] However, the effect
      of food does not appear to impact the total absorption of pregabalin in a way that is

    <name>Temazepam</name>
    <metabolism>First-pass metabolism of temazepam is minimal at approximately 5-8% of an
      administered dose [F3718, L5539]. Nevertheless, temazepam is principally metabolized in the
      liver where most of the unchanged drug is directly conjugated to glucuronide and excreted in
      the urine [F3718, L5539]. In particular, the primary metabolite present in the blood is the
      O-conjugate of temazepam [FDA Label, F3718, L5539]. Less than 5% of the drug is demethylated
      to oxazepam and subsequently eliminated as the glucuronide [F3718, L5539]. Regardless, the
      glucuronides of temazepam have no demonstrable CNS activity and it is believed that no active
      metabolites are formed in general [FDA Label, F3718, L5539]. Since temazepam mainly undergoes
      Phase II conjugation reactions, it is proposed that it is devoid of CYP450
      interactions.[A38982]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Studies demonstrate that between 90 to 100% of an orally administered temazepam dose
      is absorbed, making the medication very well absorbed [F3718, L5539]. The oral administration
      of 15 to 45 mg temazepam resulted in rapid absorption with significant blood levels achieved
      in 30 minutes and peak levels at 2-3 hours [F3718, L5539]. In particular, direct studies
      following the oral ingestion of 30 mg of temazepam revealed measurable plasma concentrations
      were obtained 10-20 minutes after dosing with peak plasma levels ranging between 666-982 ng/mL
      (with a mean of 865 ng/mL) presenting approximately 1.2-1.6 hours (with a mean of 1.5 hours)
      after the dosing [FDA Label]. Finally, a dose-proportional relationship was established for
      the area under the plasma concentration/time curve over the 15 to 30 mg dose range [FDA

    <name>Ziprasidone</name>
    <metabolism>Ziprasidone is heavily metabolized in the liver with less than 5% of the drug
      excreted unchanged in the urine.[A174277] The primary reductive pathway is catalyzed by
      aldehyde oxidase, while 2 other less prominent oxidative pathways are catalyzed by
      CYP3A4.[A174277] Ziprasidone is unlikely to interact with other medications metabolized by
      CYP3A4 since only 1/3 of the antipsychotic is metabolized by the CYP3A4 system.[A174277]

      There are 12 identified ziprasidone metabolites (abbreviations italicized): Ziprasidone
      sulfoxide, ziprasidone sulfone, (6-chloro-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-5-yl)acetic acid
      (_OX-COOH_), OX-COOH glucuronide, 3-(piperazine-1-yl)-1,2-benzisothiazole (_BITP_), BITP
      sulfoxide, BITP sulfone, BITP sulfone lactam, S-Methyl-dihydro-ziprasidone,
      S-Methyl-dihydro-ziprasidone-sulfoxide,
      6-chloro-5-(2-piperazin-1-yl-ethyl)-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one (_OX-P_), and
      dihydro-ziprasidone-sulfone.[A190558]

      As suggested by the quantity of metabolites, ziprasidone is metabolized through several
      different pathways. Ziprasidone is sequentially oxidized to ziprasidone sulfoxide and
      ziprasidone sulfone, and oxidative N-dealkylation of ziprasidone produces OX-COOH and
      BITP.[A190558] OX-COOH undergoes phase II metabolism to yield a glucuronidated metabolite
      while BITP is sequentially oxidized into BITP sulfoxide, BITP sulfone, then BITP sulfone
      lactam.[A190558] Ziprasidone can also undergo reductive cleavage and methylation to produce
      S-Methyl-dihydro-ziprasidone and then further oxidation to produce
      S-Methyl-dihydro-ziprasidone-sulfoxide.[A190558] Finally dearylation of ziprasidone produces
      OX-P, and the process of hydration and oxidation transforms the parent drug into
      dihydro-ziprasidone-sulfone.[A190558]

      Although CYP3A4 and aldehyde oxidase are the primary enzymes involved in ziprasidone
      metabolism[A174277], the pathways associated with each enzyme have not been specified.

    </metabolism>
    <absorption>In the absence of food, ziprasidone's oral bioavailability is 60%, and absorption
      may reach 100% if ziprasidone is taken with a meal containing at least 500 kcal. The
      difference in bioavailability has little to do with the fat content of the food and appears to
      be related to the bulk of the meal since more absorption occurs the longer ziprasidone remains
      in the stomach.[A174562]</absorption>

      CYP2C19: _(R)-p-HPPH_ and _(S)-p-HPPH_.[A33595] When CYP2C19 catalyzes the reaction, the ratio
      of stereoisomers is roughly 1:1, whereas when CYP2C9 catalyzes the reaction, the ratio heavily
      favours the "S" stereoisomer.[A33595] Since the metabolism of phenytoin is in part influenced
      by genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, this ratio can be utilized to identify
      different genomic variants of the enzymes.[A188772,A188832,A33595]

      EPHX1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 are responsible for
      producing the _phenytoin dihydrodiol_ metabolite.[A33595]

      _Hydroxyphenytoin_ can be metabolized by CYP2C19, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A7, CYP2B6 and
      CYP2D6 to a _phenytoin catechol_ metabolite or undergo glucuronidation by UGT1A6, UGT1A9,
      UGT1A1, and UGT1A4 to a _glucuronide metabolite_ that can be eliminated in the urine.[A33595]
      On the other hand, the _phenytoin dihydrodiol_ entity is only transformed to the _catechol_
      metabolite.[A33595]

      The _catechol metabolite_ can undergo methylation by COMT and be subsequently eliminated in
      the urine, or can spontaneously oxidize to a _phenytoin quinone_ (NQO1 can transform the
      quinone back to the catechol metabolite).[A33595]

      Of note, although CYP2C18 is poorly expressed in the liver, the enzyme is active in the skin
      and is involved in the primary and secondary hydroxylation of phenytoin.[A33595,A189312] This
      CYP2C18 mediated bioactivation may be linked to the manifestation of adverse cutaneous drug
      reactions associated with phenytoin.[A33595]

      oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation
      [F4349, L5930]. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites
      monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide [F4349, L5930]. The pharmacological/toxicological
      actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine HCl
      [F4349, L5930]. Approximately 90% of lidocaine HCl administered is excreted in the form of
      various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged [F4349, L5930]. The primary
      metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline [F4349, L5930].</metabolism>
    <absorption>In general, lidocaine is readily absorbed across mucous membranes and damaged skin
      but poorly through intact skin [F4468]. The agent is quickly absorbed from the upper airway,
      tracheobronchial tree, and alveoli into the bloodstream [F4468]. And although lidocaine is
      also well absorbed across the gastrointestinal tract the oral bioavailability is only about
      35% as a result of a high degree of first-pass metabolism [F4468]. After injection into
      tissues, lidocaine is also rapidly absorbed and the absorption rate is affected by both
      vascularity and the presence of tissue and fat capable of binding lidocaine in the particular
      tissues [F4468].

      The concentration of lidocaine in the blood is subsequently affected by a variety of aspects,
      including its rate of absorption from the site of injection, the rate of tissue distribution,
      and the rate of metabolism and excretion [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, the systemic
      absorption of lidocaine is determined by the site of injection, the dosage given, and its
      pharmacological profile [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The maximum blood concentration occurs
      following intercostal nerve blockade followed in order of decreasing concentration, the lumbar
      epidural space, brachial plexus site, and subcutaneous tissue [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The total
      dose injected regardless of the site is the primary determinant of the absorption rate and
      blood levels achieved [F4349, L5930, L5948]. There is a linear relationship between the amount
      of lidocaine injected and the resultant peak anesthetic blood levels [F4349, L5930, L5948].
      Nevertheless, it has been observed that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed
      following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending also on lipid solubility
      and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Except for
      intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal
      nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration [F4349, L5930, L5948].

      O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV).[L43030] Venlafaxine can also undergo N-demethylation mediated by
      CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to form N-desmethylvenlafaxine (NDV) but this is a minor
      metabolic pathway.[A14753] ODV and NDV further metabolized by CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 to
      form N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine (NODV) [A6998] and NODV can be further metabolized to form N,
      N, O-tridesmethylvenlafaxine, followed by a possible glucuronidation.[A19479]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Venlafaxine is well absorbed after oral administration with an absolute
      bioavailability of approximately 45%. In mass balance studies, at least 92% of a single oral
      dose of venlafaxine was absorbed. After twice-daily oral administration of immediate-release
      formulation of 150 mg venlafaxine, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 150 ng/mL and
      T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 5.5 hours. C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and
      T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of ODV were 260 ng/mL and nine hours, respectively. The
      extended-release formulation of venlafaxine has a slower rate of absorption, but the same
      extent of absorption as the immediate-release formulation. After once-daily administration of
      extended-release formulation of 75 mg venlafaxine, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 225 ng/mL
      and T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was two hours. C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and

    <name>Conjugated estrogens</name>
    <metabolism>The conjugated estrogens are metabolized by a number of different pathways. One of
      the metabolic pathways of the conjugated estrogens is driven by the action of the cytochrome
      isoenzyme CYP3A4.[A175552] On the other hand, the conjugated estrogens can also be processed
      by a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversion and sulfate conjugation. Some of the
      principal metabolic reactions of the conjugated estrogens are driven by the conversion of
      17beta-estradiol to estrone and the further change to estriol. A portion of the administered
      conjugated estrogens will remain in the blood as sulfate conjugates which serve as a
      circulating reservoir for the generation of new estrogens.[A38238]

      In the endometrium, equilin is metabolized to 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy equilin as well as
      2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy estradiol. This hydroxylation process is very large in various of the
      components of the conjugated estrogens and hence, the major metabolites in urine are known to
      be 17-ketosteroid-16-alpha-hydroxy estrone, 16-alpha-hydroxy-17-beta-dihydro equilin and
      16-alpha-hydroxy-17-beta-dihydroequilenin.[A175594]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The conjugated estrogens are well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and the
      maximum plasma concentration of the conjugated estrogens is reached after 7 hours depending on
      the estrone component.[A175552] The maximal plasma concentration of conjugated estrogens after
      multiple doses of 0.45 mg is reported to be of 2.6 ng/ml with an AUC in the steady state of 35
      ng.h/ml.[A38238] Unconjugated estrogens are known to be cleared from the circulation at a
      faster rate than their ester forms.[A175594]</absorption>

    <name>Atomoxetine</name>
    <metabolism>Atomoxetine undergoes biotransformation primarily through the cytochrome P450 2D6
      (CYP2D6) enzymatic pathway. People with reduced activity in the CYP2D6 pathway (also known as
      poor metabolizers or PMs) have higher plasma concentrations of atomoxetine compared with
      people with normal activity (also known as extensive metabolizers, or EMs). For PMs, the AUC
      of atomoxetine at steady-state is approximately 10-fold higher and Cmax is about 5-fold
      greater than for EMs.

      The major oxidative metabolite formed regardless of CYP2D6 status is 4-hydroxy-atomoxetine,
      which is rapidly glucuronidated. 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine is equipotent to atomoxetine as an
      inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter, but circulates in plasma at much lower
      concentrations (1% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 0.1% of atomoxetine concentration
      in PMs).

      In individuals that lack CYP2D6 activity, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is still the primary
      metabolite, but is formed by several other cytochrome P450 enzymes and at a slower rate.
      Another minor metabolite, N-Desmethyl-atomoxetine is formed by CYP2C19 and other cytochrome
      P450 enzymes, but has much less pharmacological activity than atomoxetine and lower plasma
      concentrations (5% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 45% of atomoxetine concentration in
      PMs).[F4639]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The pharmacokinetic profile of atomoxetine is highly dependent on cytochrome P450
      2D6 genetic polymorphisms of the individual.[A175669] A large fraction of the population (up
      to 10% of Caucasians and 2% of people of African descent and 1% of Asians) are poor
      metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6 metabolized drugs. These individuals have reduced activity in
      this pathway resulting in 10-fold higher AUCs, 5-fold higher peak plasma concentrations, and
      slower elimination (plasma half-life of 21.6 hours) of atomoxetine compared with people with
      normal CYP2D6 activity.

      Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of
      about 63% in extensive metabolizers (EMs) and 94% in poor metabolizers (PMs). Mean maximal
      plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing with a
      maximal concentration of 350 ng/ml with an AUC of 2 mcg.h/ml.[A175669]

    <name>Acetaminophen</name>
    <metabolism>Acetaminophen is the major metabolite of _phenacetin_ and _acetanilid_.[F4124]
      Acetaminophen is mainly metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and its metabolism of
      comprised of 3 pathways: conjugation with glucuronide, conjugation with sulfate, and oxidation
      through the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway, mainly CYP2E1, to produce a reactive metabolite
      (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine or NAPQI). At normal therapeutic doses, NAPQI undergoes fast
      conjugation with glutathione and is subsequently metabolized to produce both cysteine and
      mercapturic acid conjugates.[Label]

      High doses of acetaminophen (overdoses) can lead to hepatic necrosis due to the depletion of
      glutathione and of binding of high levels of reactive metabolite (NAPQI) to important parts of
      liver cells. The abovementioned damage to the liver can be prevented by the early
      administration of sulfhydryl compounds, for example, methionine and N-acetylcysteine.[A35814]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Acetaminophen has 88% oral bioavailability and reaches its highest plasma
      concentration 90 minutes after ingestion.[A35815]
      Peak blood levels of free acetaminophen are not reached until 3 hours after rectal
      administration of the suppository form of acetaminophen and the peak blood concentration is
      approximately 50% of the observed concentration after the ingestion of an equivalent oral dose
      (10-20 mcg/mL).[F4124]

      The percentage of a systemically absorbed rectal dose of acetaminophen is inconsistent,
      demonstrated by major differences in the bioavailability of acetaminophen after a dose
      administered rectally. Higher rectal doses or an increased frequency of administration may be
      used to attain blood concentrations of acetaminophen similar to those attained after oral
      acetaminophen administration.[Label] </absorption>

    <name>Codeine</name>
    <metabolism>Approximately 70 to 80% of the ingested dose of codeine is metabolized in the liver
      by conjugation with glucuronic acid to _codeine-6­ glucuronide_ (C6G) and by O-demethylation
      to _morphine_ (about 5-10%) and N-demethylation to _norcodeine_ (about 10%) respectively.
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major metabolic enzymes mediating the
      glucurodination of codeine to the metabolite, _codeine 6 glucuronide_.

      Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for the transformation of codeine to
      morphine and P450 3A4 is the main enzyme mediating the conversion of codeine to _norcodeine_.
      Morphine and norcodeine are then further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The
      glucuronide metabolites of morphine are _morphine-3-glucuronide_ (M3G) and_
      morphine-6-glucuronide _(M6G). Morphine and M6G have been proven to have analgesic activity in
      humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is not known at this time. Norcodeine and M3G

      there was no significant change in the absorption of codeine [FDA label].

      **Steady-state concentration**

      The administration of 15 mg codeine sulfate every 4 hours for 5 days lead to steady-state
      concentrations of codeine, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide

    <name>Hydromorphone</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of hydromorphone is mainly hepatic and it is represented by the
      generation of hydromorphone-3-glucuronide through glucuronidation reactions.[A176468] This
      primary metabolic pathway is done by the activity of the
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7.[A176501] The first-pass hepatic metabolism is so large that
      it represents 62% of the initial administered dose.[A176495]

      On the other hand, hydromorphone is also characterized by the presence of minor metabolic
      pathways such as the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-driven generation of norhydromorphone.[A39478]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The immediate release version of hydromorphone reaches its peak concentration after
      30-60 minutes while the extended-release version reaches the peak concentration after 9
      hours.[A176468] When administered orally, hydromorphone is absorbed mainly in the upper small
      intestine with a bioavailability of 60% due to intensive first-pass metabolism. In the
      controlled-release version of hydromorphone, the absorption follows a biphasic pharmacokinetic
      profile. However, even though there are clear distinctions in the absorption pathway of
      hydromorphone, the AUC of both versions is reported to be of 34 ng.h/ml which indicates an
      equivalence.[A176471]

      The parenteral administration of hydromorphone, which is the most common pathway, presents an
      almost immediate absorption as observed by the presence of peak plasma concentration almost
      immediately. This peak plasma concentration declines rapidly due to fast redistribution into
      liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle. In the parenteral route, the pharmacokinetic
      profile is log-linear and dose-dependent and to present a higher bioavailability of
      78%.[A176471]

      metabolism.[A177949]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Indometacin displays a linear pharmacokinetics profile where the plasma
      concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) are dose-proportional, whereas half-life (T1/2)
      and plasma and renal clearance are dose-dependent.[A177871] Indometacin is readily and rapidly
      absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability is virtually 100% following oral
      administration [A177871] and about 90% of the dose is absorbed within 4 hours.[L6778] The
      bioavailability is about 80-90% following rectal administration.[A177901]

      The peak plasma concentrations following a single oral dose were achieved between 0.9 ± 0.4
      and 1.5 ± 0.8 hours in a fasting state.[A177901] Despite large intersubject variation as well

    <absorption>**Regular tablet absorption**

      The absolute bioavailability of a metformin 500 mg tablet administered in the fasting state is
      about 50%-60%. Single-dose clinical studies using oral doses of metformin 500 to 1500 mg and
      850 to 2550 mg show that there is a lack of dose proportionality with an increase in metformin
      dose, attributed to decreased absorption rather than changes in elimination.[L40243]

      At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations
      of metformin are achieved within 24-48 hours and are normally measured at &lt;1 μg/mL.[L40243]
      **Extended-release tablet absorption**

      After a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, Cmax is reached with a median value of
      7 hours and a range of between 4 and 8 hours. Peak plasma levels are measured to be about 20%
      lower compared to the same dose of regular metformin, however, the extent of absorption of
      both forms (as measured by area under the curve - AUC), are similar.[L12207]

      **Effect of food**

      Food reduces the absorption of metformin, as demonstrated by about a 40% lower mean peak
      plasma concentration (Cmax), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve
      (AUC), and a 35-minute increase in time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) after ingestion of
      an 850 mg tablet of metformin taken with food, compared to the same dose administered during
      fasting.[L40243]

      Though the extent of metformin absorption (measured by the area under the curve - AUC) from
      the metformin extended-release tablet is increased by about 50% when given with food, no
      effect of food on Cmax and Tmax of metformin is observed. High and low-fat meals exert similar

    <name>Methadone</name>
    <metabolism>Methadone undergoes fairly extensive first-pass metabolism. Cytochrome P450 enzymes,
      primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6, are
      responsible for conversion of methadone to EDDP (2-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine)
      and other inactive metabolites, which are excreted mainly in the urine. Methadone first
      undergoes N-demethylation to form a highly unstable compound that spontaneously converts to
      EDDP through cyclization and dehydration. EDDP is then converted to
      2-ethyl5-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EDMP). Both EDDP and EDMP are
      inactive.[F4685,F4691,A185234]

      The CYP isozymes also demonstrate different affinities for metabolizing the different
      methadone enantiomers: CYP2C19, CYP3A7, and CYP2C8 preferentially metabolize (R)-methadone
      while CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C18 preferentially metabolize (S)-methadone. CYP3A4 does not
      have an enantiomer preference.[A184061,A185234]

      Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the cytochrome P450 enzymes can impact methadone
      pharmacokinetics and contribute to the interindividual variation in response to methadone
      therapy. In particular, CYP2B6 polymorphisms have been shown to impact individual response to
      methadone as it is the predominant determinant involved in the N-demethylation of methadone,
      clearance, and the metabolic ratios of [methadone\]/[EDDP].[A184610] The SNPs CYP2B6\*6, \*9,
      \*11, CYP2C19\*2, \*3, CYP3A4\*1B, and CYP3A5\*3 result in increased methadone plasma
      concentrations, decreased N-demethylation, and decreased methadone clearance, while homozygous
      carriers of CYP2B6\*6/\*6 demonstrate diminished metabolism and clearance of
      methadone.[A184610] See the pharmacogenomics section for further information.

      Pharmacogenomic effects on the CYP enzymes can be significant as the long half-life of
      methadone can result in some individuals having higher than normal therapeutic levels which
      puts them at risk of dose-related side effects. For example, elevated (R)-methadone levels can
      increase the risk of respiratory depression, while elevated (S)-methadone levels can increase
      the risk of severe cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonged QTc interval.[A184610]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Methadone is one of the more lipid-soluble opioids and is well absorbed from the
      gastrointestinal tract. Following oral administration of methadone, bioavailability ranges
      from 36-100%, with a marked interindividual variation. It can be detected in blood as soon as
      15-45 minutes following administration with peak plasma concentrations achieved between 1 to
      7.5 hours. A second peak is observed ~4 hours after administration and is likely due to
      enterohepatic circulation. Dose proportionality of methadone pharmacokinetics is not
      known.[A497,F4685,F4688,F4691]

      Following administration of daily oral doses ranging from 10 to 225 mg the steady-state plasma
      concentrations ranged between 65 to 630 ng/mL and the peak concentrations ranged between 124
      to 1255 ng/mL. Effect of food on the bioavailability of methadone has not been
      evaluated.[A497,F4685,F4688,F4691]

      Slower absorption is observed in opioid users compared to healthy subjects, which may reflect
      the pharmacological effect of opioids in slowing gastric emptying and
      mobility.[A497,F4685,F4688,F4691]

      Due to the large inter-individual variation in methadone pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics, treatment should be individualized to each patient. There was an up to
      17-fold interindividual variation found in methadone blood concentrations for a given dosage,
      likely due in part to individual variability in CYP enzyme function.[A497] There is also a
      large variability in pharmacokinetics between methadone's enantiomers, which further
      complicates pharmacokinetic interpretation and study.[A183995]</absorption>

    <name>Omeprazole</name>
    <metabolism>Omeprazole is heavily metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme
      system. The main part of its metabolism depends on the polymorphically expressed CYP2C19,
      which is responsible for the formation of _hydroxyomeprazole_, the major metabolite found in
      plasma. The remaining part depends on CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of _omeprazole
      sulphone_ [FDA label]. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Omeprazole delayed-release capsules contain an enteric-coated granule formulation of
      omeprazole (because omeprazole is acid-labile), so that absorption of omeprazole begins only
      after the granules exit the stomach [FDA label].

      Absorption of omeprazole occurs rapidly, with peak plasma concentrations of omeprazole
      achieved within 0.5-3.5 hours [FDA label].

      Absolute bioavailability (compared with intravenous administration) is approximately 30-40% at
      doses of 20-40 mg, largely due to pre-systemic metabolism. The bioavailability of omeprazole
      increases slightly upon repeated administration of omeprazole delayed-release capsules [FDA
      label].</absorption>

    <name>Cetirizine</name>
    <metabolism>A mass balance clinical trial comprised of 6 healthy male study volunteers showed
      that 70% of the administered radioactivity was measured in the urine and 10% in the feces
      after cetirizine administration. About 50% of the radioactivity was measured in the urine as
      unchanged cetirizine. Most of the rapid increase in peak plasma radioactivity was related to
      the parent drug, implying a low level of first pass metabolism. This prevents potential
      interactions of cetirizine with drugs interacting with hepatic cytochrome enzymes [A175051].
      Cetirizine is metabolized partially by oxidative O-dealkylation to a metabolite with
      insignificant antihistaminic activity. The enzyme or enzymes responsible for this step in
      cetirizine metabolism have not yet been identified [FDA label].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Cetirizine was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of about
      1 hour after oral administration of tablets or syrup formulation in adult volunteers [FDA

      When healthy study volunteers were given several doses of cetirizine (10 mg tablets once daily
      for 10 days), a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 311 ng/mL was measured [FDA label].

    <name>Diltiazem</name>
    <metabolism>Diltiazem is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, which explains its
      relatively low absolute oral bioavailability. It undergoes N-demethylation primarily mediated
      by CYP3A4. CYP2D6 is responsible for O-demethylation and esterases mediate
      deacetylation.[A39292] There was large inter-individual variability in the circulating plasma
      levels of metabolites in healthy volunteers.[A178516]

      In healthy volunteers, the major circulating metabolites in the plasma are N-monodesmethyl
      diltilazem, deacetyl diltiazem, and deacetyl N-monodesmethyl diltiazem, which are all
      pharmacologically active.[A178516] Deacetyl diltiazem retains about 25-50% of the
      pharmacological activity to that of the parent compound.[L10556] Deacetyl diltiazem can be
      further transformed into deacetyl diltiazem N-oxide or deacetyl O-desmethyl diltiazem.
      N-monodesmethyl diltilazem can be further metabolized to N,O-didesmethyl diltiazem. Deacetyl
      N-monodesmethyl diltiazem can be further metabolized to deacetyl N,O-didesmethyl diltiazem,
      which can be glucuronidated or sulphated.[A178516] Diltiazem can be O-demethylated by CYP2D6
      to form O-desmethyl diltiazem.[A39292]
    </metabolism>
    <absorption>Diltiazem is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Minimum therapeutic
      plasma diltiazem concentrations appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ng/mL. Following oral
      administration of extended formulations of 360 mg diltiazem, the drug in plasma was detectable
      within 3 to 4 hours and the peak plasma concentrations were reached between 11 and 18 hours
      post-dose. Diltiazem peak and systemic exposures were not affected by concurrent food
      intake.[L10556] Due to hepatic first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability following
      oral administration is about 40%,[L10556] with the value ranging from 24 to 74% due to high
      interindividual variation in the first pass effect.[A178420] The bioavailability may increase

      metabolism.[L9251]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Alfuzosin is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and the absolute
      bioavailability under fed conditions is 49%.[L9251] In patients over 75 years of age,

      mentions a bioavailability of 64%.[L31638] After multiple doses under fed conditions, Cmax is
      achieved in 8 hours. Cmax and AUC0-24 values are about 13.6 ng/mL and 194 ng·h/mL,
      respectively. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after the second dose and are
      1.2 to 1.6 times higher than after a single dose.[L9251] With the extended-release

      4'-hydroxyclobazam, respectively. N-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) retains pharmacological
      activity. Norclobazam is one-fourth the potency of clobazam. The main enzyme that facilitates
      the process of N-demethylation is CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP2B6.
      Norclobazam itself is also metabolized via hydroxylation, primarily by CYP2C19. The formation
      of 4'-hydroxyclobazam is facilitated by CYP2C18 and CYP2C19. A factor in determining extent of
      metabolism is the genetic profile of the individual patient as CYP2C19 is a polymorphic

      deacetylvinorelbine. Deacetylvinorelbine has been demonstrated to be the primary metabolite of
      vinorelbine in humans, and has been shown to possess antitumor activity similar to vinorelbine
      [L2005], [L2006].

      Vinorelbine is metabolized into two other minor metabolites, 20'-hydroxyvinorelbine and
      vinorelbine 6'-oxide [L2006].

      Therapeutic doses of vinorelbine (30 mg/m2) yield very small, if any, quantifiable levels of
      either metabolite in blood or urine. The metabolism of vinorelbine is mediated by hepatic
      cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily [L2004], [A32354].

      As the liver provides the main route for metabolism of the drug, patients with hepatic
      impairment may demonstrate increased toxicity with standard dosing, however, there are no
      available data on this. Likewise, the contribution of cytochrome P450 enzyme action to

    <name>Treprostinil</name>
    <metabolism>Treprostinil is mostly metabolized by the liver, mainly by CYP2C8, and by CYP2C9 to
      a lesser extent.[L41855,L41860,L41865] Treprostinil does not have a single major metabolite.
      The five metabolites detected in urine (HU1 through HU5) accounted for 13.8, 14.3, 15.5, 10.6
      and 10.2% of the dose, respectively.[L41880] One of the metabolites (HU5) is the glucuronide
      conjugate of treprostinil. HU1, HU2, HU3 and HU4 are formed through the oxidation of the
      3-hydroxyloctyl side chain.[L41855,L41860,L41865,L41880] None of the metabolites of
      treprostinil appear to be active. _In vitro_ studies suggest that treprostinil does not
      inhibit or induce any major CYP enzymes.[L41855,L41860]</metabolism>
    <absorption>After subcutaneous infusion, treprostinil is completely absorbed, with a
      bioavailability of about 100%, and it reaches steady-state concentrations in approximately 10
      hours.[L41860] The pharmacokinetics of treprostinil follow a two-compartment model and are
      linear between 2.5 and 125 ng/kg/min.[L41860] Subcutaneous and intravenous doses of
      treprostinil are bioequivalent at 10 ng/kg/min. Compared to healthy subjects, patients with
      mild and moderate hepatic insufficiency had a corresponding C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; 2- and
      4-times higher and an AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-∞&lt;/sub&gt; 3- and 5-times higher when given a
      subcutaneous treprostinil dose of 10 ng/kg/min for 150 min.[L41860]

      When given orally at doses between 0.5 and 15 mg twice a day, treprostinil follows a
      dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile.[L41865] The oral bioavailability of treprostinil is
      17%, and drug concentration reaches its highest level between 4 and 6 hours after oral
      administration.[L41865] The oral absorption of treprostinil is affected by food. The AUC and
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of oral treprostinil increase 49% and 13%, respectively, when this
      drug is administered with a high-fat, high-calorie meal.[L41865]

      The AUC and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of inhaled treprostinil were proportional to the doses
      administered (18 to 90 μg).[L41855] The bioavailability of inhaled treprostinil was 64% in
      patients receiving 2 doses of 18 μg, and 72% in patients receiving two doses of 36 μg.[L41855]
      Two separate studies that evaluated the pharmacokinetics of inhaled treprostinil at a
      maintenance dose of 54 μg found that the mean C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 0.91 and 1.32
      ng/mL, respectively, with a corresponding T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.25 and 0.12 hr and
      a mean AUC of 0.81 and 0.97 hr⋅ng/mL.[L41855]</absorption>

    <name>Triamterene</name>
    <metabolism>Triamterene undergoes phase I metabolism involving hydroxylation, via CYP1A2
      activity, to form 4'-hydroxytriamterene. 4'-Hydroxytriamterene is further transformed in phase
      II metabolism mediated by cytosolic sulfotransferases to form the major metabolite,
      4′-hydroxytriamterene sulfate, which retains a diuretic activity. [A39120,L6163] Both the
      plasma and urine levels of this metabolite greatly exceed triamterene levels [L6166] while the
      renal clearance of the sulfate conjugate was les than that of triamterene; this low renal
      clearance of the sulfate conjugate as compared with triamterene may be explained by the low
      unbound fraction of the metabolite in plasma.[A178057] </metabolism>
    <absorption>Triamterene is shown to be rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract
      [L6166,T28] Its onset of action achiveved within 2 to 4 hours after oral ingestion [L6166] and
      its duration of action is 12-16 hours.[T28] It is reported that the diuretic effect of
      triamterene may not be observed for several days after administration.[L6166] In a
      pharmacokinetic study, the oral bioavailability of triamterene was determined to be
      52%.[A178012] Following administration of a single oral dose to fasted healthy male
      volunteers, the mean AUC of triamterene was about 148.7 ng*hr/mL [L6169] and the mean peak
      plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 46.4 ng/mL reached at 1.1 hour after administration.[L6169]
      In a limited study, administration of triamterene in combination with hydrochlorothiazide
      resulted in an increased bioavailability of triamterene by about 67% and a delay of up to 2
      hours in the absorption of the drug.[L6169] It is advised that triamterene is administered
      after meals; in a limited study, combination use of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide with
      the consumption of a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in the mean bioavailability and
      peak serum concentrations of triamterene and its active sulfate metabolite, as well as a delay
      of up to 2 hours in the absorption of the active constituents.[L6169]</absorption>

      bisdigitoxoside_. Their glucuronidated and sulfated conjugates are thought to be produced
      through the process of hydrolysis, oxidation, and additionally, conjugation. The cytochrome
      P-450 system does not play a major role in digoxin metabolism, nor does this drug induce or
      inhibit the enzymes in this system.[L9143]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Digoxin is approximately 70-80% absorbed in the first part of the small
      bowel.[A178228] The bioavailability of an oral dose varies from 50-90%, however, oral
      gelatinized capsules of digoxin are reported to have a bioavailability of 100%.[A178252] Tmax,
      or the time to reach the maximum concentration of digoxin was measured to be 1.0 h in one
      clinical study of healthy patients taking 0.25 mg of digoxin with a placebo.[A178369] Cmax, or
      maximum concentration, was 1.32 ± 0.18 ng/ml−1 in the same study, and AUC (area under the
      curve) was 12.5 ± 2.38 ng/ml−1.[A178369]
      If digoxin is ingested after a meal, absorption is slowed but this does not change the total
      amount of absorbed drug. If digoxin is taken with meals that are in fiber, absorption may be
      decreased.[L6274]

      **A note on gut bacteria**

      An oral dose of digoxin may be transformed into pharmacologically inactive products by
      bacteria in the colon. Studies have indicated that 10% of patients receiving digoxin tablets
      will experience the degradation of at least 40% of an ingested dose of digoxin by gut
      bacteria. Several antibiotics may increase the absorption of digoxin in these patients, due to
      the elimination of gut bacteria, which normally cause digoxin degradation.[L9143]

      **A note on malabsorption**

      Patients with malabsorption due to a variety of causes may have a decreased ability to absorb
      digoxin.[L9143] P-glycoprotein, located on cells in the intestine, may interfere with digoxin
      pharmacokinetics, as it is a substrate of this efflux transporter. P-glycoprotein can be
      induced by other drugs, therefore reducing the effects of digoxin by increasing its efflux in
      the intestine.[L9143] </absorption>

      Following oral administration of progesterone in the micronized soft-gelatin capsule

      serum progesterone concentration increased in a dose-proportional and linear fashion after
      multiple doses of progesterone capsules, ranging from 100 mg/day to 300 mg/day [FDA label].
      **IM administration**

      After intramuscular (IM) administration of 10 mg of progesterone in oil, the maximum plasma
      concentrations were achieved in about 8 hours post-injection and plasma concentrations stayed
      above baseline for approximately 24 hours post-injection. Injections of 10, 25, and 50 mg lead
      to geometric mean values for maximum plasma concentration (CMAX) of 7, 28, and 50 ng/mL,
      respectively [F3916]. Progesterone administered by the intramuscular (IM) route avoids
      significant first-pass hepatic metabolism. As a result, endometrial tissue concentrations of
      progesterone achieved with IM administration are higher when compared with oral
      administration. Despite this, the highest concentrations of progesterone in endometrial tissue
      are reached with vaginal administration [A175657].

      **Note on oral contraceptive tablet absorption**

      Serum progestin levels peak about 2 hours after oral administration of progesterone-only
      contraceptive tablets, followed by rapid distribution and elimination. By 24 hours after drug
      administration, serum levels remain near the baseline, making efficacy dependent upon strict
      adherence to the dosing schedule. Large variations in serum progesterone levels occur among
      individuals. Progestin-only administration leads to lower steady-state serum progestin levels
      and a shorter elimination half-life than concurrent administration with estrogens [F3904]. </absorption>

      enzymes are believed to play a major role in the metabolism of nisoldipine. The particular

    <absorption>Alprazolam administered orally is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract,

      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 12-22 μg/L.[A177925, L34783]

      The extended-release formulation of alprazolam (XANAX XR) has similar absorption,
      bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics as the standard release, with the exception that the
      T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is ~10 hours compared to 1-2 hours. Temporal dosing alters these

      decreasing by one hour when dosed at night as opposed to in the morning.[L34788]

      Food has an effect on alprazolam absorption; a high-fat meal up to two hours before dosing
      increases the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; by ~25% and either a reduction (food consumed

    <absorption>Concerta®: Methylphenidate is readily absorbed. Following oral administration of
      Concerta, plasma methylhphenidate concentrations reach an initial maximum at about 1 hour
      followed by gradual ascending concentrations over the next 5-9 hours. Mean times to reach peak
      plasma concentrations across all doses of Concerta occurred between 6-10 hours. Once daily
      dosing minimizes the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with
      multiple doses of immediate-release methylphenidate treatments.[F4474] Depending on the doses
      provided, Cmax was found to range from 6.0-15.0ng/mL, Tmax ranged from 8.1-9.4h, and AUC
      ranged from 50.4-121.5 ng·h/mL in children.[F4474]

      When provided as Concerta®, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic
      Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an
      immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.[A631] OROS is comprised of an
      osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an
      immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug
      overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial
      immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane
      into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing
      methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta
      also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.

      Biphentin®: Methylphenidate is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration,
      with peak blood levels obtained in 1-3 hours.[F4480]

      When provided as Biphentin®, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release
      delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is
      provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate
      doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time
      profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect
      for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD
      impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the workday, etc).
      Methylphenidate (immediate release): Methylphenidate hydrochloride is rapidly and extensively
      absorbed from the tablets following oral administration; however, owing to extensive
      first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is low (approx. 30%) and large individual differences

      intracellularly and extracellularly by cytidine deaminase to its inactive metabolite
      2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine or 2´-deoxy-2´,2´-difluorouridine (dFdU). Deamination occurs in the

    <absorption>The absorption and potency of any topical corticosteroid including betamethasone
      depends on the vehicle in which the steroid is delivered. For example, betamethasone

      betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% cream or lotion is considered to be moderately
      potent.[A192375]

      There are several structural modifications that can determine the potency of a topical
      corticosteroid. For example, corticosteroids containing a halogen at specific carbons, or that
      contain esters are more potent due to enhanced lipophilicity.[A192378] As such, there is a
      marked difference between topical products containing betamethasone dipropionate vs.
      betamethasone valerate. Betamethasone dipropionate contains 2 esters which enhances its
      potency, while betamethasone valerate has only one ester and is less potent.[A192378]

    <name>Haloperidol</name>
    <metabolism>Haloperidol is extensively metabolised in the liver with only about 1% of the
      administered dose excreted unchanged in urine.[A32346]

      In humans, haloperidol is biotransformed to various metabolites, including
      p-fluorobenzoylpropionic acid, 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine, reduced haloperidol,
      pyridinium metabolites, and haloperidol glucuronide. In psychiatric patients treated regularly
      with haloperidol, the concentration of haloperidol glucuronide in plasma is the highest among
      the metabolites, followed, in rank order, by unchanged haloperidol, reduced haloperidol and
      reduced haloperidol glucuronide.

      The drug is thought to be metabolized primarily by oxidative N-dealkylation of the piperidine
      nitrogen to form fluorophenylcarbonic acids and piperidine metabolites (which appear to be
      inactive), and by reduction of the butyrophenone carbonyl to the carbinol, forming
      _hydroxyhaloperidol_.

      The enzymes involved in the biotransformation of haloperidol include cytochrome P450 (CYP)
      including CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, carbonyl reductase and uridine di-phosphoglucose
      glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. The greatest proportion of the intrinsic hepatic clearance of
      haloperidol is performed by glucuronidation and followed by the reduction of haloperidol to
      reduced haloperidol and by CYP-mediated oxidation.

      In studies of cytochrome-mediated disposition in vitro, CYP3A4 appears to be the major isoform
      of the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of haloperidol in humans. The intrinsic clearance
      of the back-oxidation of reduced haloperidol to the parent compound, oxidative N-dealkylation
      and pyridinium formation are of the same order of magnitude. This suggests that the same
      enzyme system is responsible for the above three metabolic reactions.

      In vivo human studies on haloperidol metabolism have shown that the glucuronidation of
      haloperidol accounts for 50 to 60% of haloperidol biotransformation and that approximately 23%
      of the biotransformation was accounted for by the reduction pathway. The remaining 20 to 30%
      ofthe biotransformation of haloperidol would be via N-dealkylation and pyridinium
      formation.[A32346] </metabolism>
    <absorption>Haloperidol is a highly lipophilic compound and is extensively metabolized in
      humans, which may cause a large interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetics.[A32346]
      Studies have found a wide variance in pharmacokinetic values for orally administered
      haloperidol with 1.7-6.1 hours reported for time to peak plasma concentration (tmax),
      14.5-36.7 hours reported for half-life (t1⁄2), and 43.73 μg/L•h [range 14.89-120.96 μg/L•h]
      reported for AUC.[A32346] Haloperidol is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when
      ingested orally, however, the first-pass hepatic metabolism decreases its oral bioavailability
      to 40 - 75%.

      After intramuscular administration, the time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) is 20 minutes
      in healthy individuals or 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia, with a mean half-life
      of 20.7 hours.[A32346] Bioavailability following intramuscular administration is higher than
      that for oral administration.

      Administration of haloperidol decanoate (the depot form of haloperidol for long-term
      treatment) in sesame oil results in slow release of the drug for long-term effects. The plasma
      concentrations of haloperidol gradually rise, reaching its peak concentration at about 6 days
      after the injection, with an apparent half-life of about 21 days. Steady-state plasma
      concentrations are achieved after the third or fourth dose.[F4645]</absorption>

      derivatives of rofecoxib, which account for nearly 56% of recovered radioactivity in the
      urine. An additional 8.8% of the dose was recovered as the glucuronide of the hydroxy
      derivative, a product of oxidative metabolism. The biotransformation of rofecoxib and this
      metabolite is reversible in humans to a limited extent (&amp;lt; 5%). These metabolites are
      inactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. Cytochrome P450 plays a minor role in metabolism of

    <absorption>Maximal plasma cefdinir concentration can be attained between 2-4 hours after an

      on the dose. Absolute bioavailability after the administration of a suspension of cefdinir is
      25%.[A180724]. The Cmax of cefdinir is 1.60 μg/mL after a 300 mg dose with an AUC of 7.05.
      Cmax is 2.87 μg/mL after a 600 mg dose with an AUC of 11.[L7330] A meal high in fat can reduce
      the absorption of cefdinir by up to 15%, however, this is not a cause for clinically
      significant changes, therefore cefdinir may be taken with or without food.[L7330] When given

    <metabolism>Pyridostigmine is hydrolyzed by cholinesterases systemically, including in the

      hydrolysis product is 3-hydroxy-N-methyl-pyridinium (HNM), which can be
      glucuronidated.[A231019, L32418] One study suggested the existence of as many as eight
      metabolites in the urine of patients receiving radiolabeled pyridostigmine intravenously,
      including various glucuronidated, demethylated, and oxidized (quinone) metabolites.[A231029,

      acetoxy-N-methyl-pyridinium.[A231034] The exact products formed, apart from HNM, require
      further validation.</metabolism>
    <absorption>Pyridostigmine administered orally is poorly absorbed in the GI tract, with an oral
      bioavailability of only 10-20%. However, this may in part be due to some metabolism by both

      60 mg, the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was determined to be 40-60 μg/L.[A231019]
      Pyridostigmine follows approximately linear kinetics, with a direct correlation between the

      to the plasma concentration vs. time curve. The peak plasma concentrations are reached ~90

    <name>Carbamazepine</name>
    <metabolism>Carbamazepine is largely metabolized in the liver. CYP3A4 hepatic enzyme is the
      major enzyme that metabolizes carbamazepine to its active metabolite,
      carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide[A180427], which is further metabolized to its trans-diol form by
      the enzyme epoxide hydrolase.[L1335] Other hepatic cytochrome enzymes that contribute to the
      metabolism of carbamazepine are CYP2C8, CYP3A5, and CYP2B6.[L7195] Carbamazepine also
      undergoes hepatic glucuronidation by UGT2B7 enzyme and several other metabolic reactions
      occur, resulting in the formation of minor hydroxy metabolites and quinone metabolites.[L7195]
      Interestingly, carbamazepine induces its own metabolism.[L1335] This leads to enhanced
      clearance, reduced half-life, and a reduction in serum levels of carbamazepine.[A180301,L1335]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The bioavailability of carbamazepine is in the range of 75-85% of an ingested
      dose.[A180301] After one 200 mg oral extended-release dose of carbamazepine in a

      was 19 ± 7 hours. After several doses of 800 mg every 12 hours, the peak concentrations of
      carbamazepine were measured to be 11.0 ± 2.5 mcg/mL. The Tmax was reduced to 5.9 ± 1.8 hours.
      Extended-release carbamazepine demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics over a range of 200–800
      mg.[L1335]

      **Effect of food on absorption**

      A meal containing high-fat content increased the rate of absorption of one 400 mg dose but not
      the AUC of carbamazepine.[L1335] The elimination half-life remained unchanged between fed and
      fasting state. The pharmacokinetics of an extended-release carbamazepine dose was demonstrated
      to be similar when administered in the fasted state or with food.[L1335] Based on these
      findings, food intake is unlikely to exert significant effects on carbamazepine absorption.

    <name>Cisatracurium</name>
    <metabolism>The degradation of cisatracurium is largely independent of liver metabolism.
      Cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination (a pH and temperature-dependent chemical process)
      to form laudanosine and the monoquaternary acrylate metabolite. Non-specific plasma esterases
      hydrolyze the monoquaternary acrylate metabolite to form the monoquaternary alcohol metabolite
      (MQA). The MQA can also undergo Hofmann elimination, but the rate of this process is slower
      than the one detected for cisatracurium. Laudanosine is further metabolized to desmethyl
      metabolites that are conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine. Laudanosine
      may cause transient hypotension and, in higher doses, cerebral excitatory effects when
      administered to several animal species; however, the effects of laudanosine in humans have not
      been established.[L43577]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The pharmacokinetics of cisatracurium follow a two-compartment open
      model.[A253602,L43577] Cisatracurium is metabolized into laudanosine and monoquaternary
      alcohol metabolite (MQA). Following the IV infusion of cisatracurium, the
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of laudanosine and MQA were 6% and 11% of the parent compound,
      respectively.[L43577]

      Compared to young patients, the volume of distribution of cisatracurium is slightly larger in
      elderly patients, which also leads to longer half-life values. The plasma clearance of
      cisatracurium was not affected by age. Patients with hepatic impairment have a slightly higher
      volume of distribution and plasma clearance values; however, these minor pharmacokinetic
      differences are not considered clinically significant. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic

    <name>Simvastatin</name>
    <metabolism>Simvastatin is administered as the inactive lactone derivative that is then
      metabolically activated to its β-hydroxyacid form by a combination of spontaneous chemical
      conversion and enzyme-mediated hydrolysis by nonspecific carboxyesterases in the intestinal
      wall, liver, and plasma. Oxidative metabolism in the liver is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and
      CYP3A5, with the remaining metabolism occurring through CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.[A181580]

      The major active metabolites of simvastatin are β-hydroxyacid metabolite and its 6'-hydroxy,
      6'-hydroxymethyl, and 6'-exomethylene derivatives.[F4655,F4658]

      Polymorphisms in the CYP3A5 gene have been shown to affect the disposition of simvastatin and
      may provide a plausible explanation for interindividual variability of simvastatin disposition
      and pharmacokinetics.[A181577]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Peak plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were attained within
      1.3 to 2.4 hours post-dose. While the recommended therapeutic dose range is 10 to 40 mg/day,
      there was no substantial deviation from linearity of AUC with an increase in dose to as high
      as 120 mg. Relative to the fasting state, the plasma profile of inhibitors was not affected
      when simvastatin was administered immediately before a test meal.[F4655,F4658]

      In a pharmacokinetic study of 17 healthy Chinese volunteers, the major PK parameters were as
      follows: Tmax 1.44 hours, Cmax 9.83 ug/L, t1/2 4.85 hours, and AUC 40.32ug·h/L.[A181571]
      Simvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, the target organ for the
      inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and the primary site of action. This tissue selectivity (and
      consequent low systemic exposure) of orally administered simvastatin has been shown to be far
      greater than that observed when the drug is administered as the enzymatically active form,
      i.e. as the open hydroxyacid.[F4658]

      In animal studies, after oral dosing, simvastatin achieved substantially higher concentrations
      in the liver than in non-target tissues. However, because simvastatin undergoes extensive
      first-pass metabolism, the bioavailability of the drug in the systemic system is low. In a
      single-dose study in nine healthy subjects, it was estimated that less than 5% of an oral dose
      of simvastatin reached the general circulation in the form of active inhibitors.[F4658]

      Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptide 1B1) hepatic
      transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family
      member 1B1) have been shown to impact simvastatin pharmacokinetics. Evidence from
      pharmacogenetic studies of the c.521T&gt;C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showed that
      simvastatin plasma concentrations were increased on average 3.2-fold for individuals
      homozygous for 521CC compared to homozygous 521TT individuals.[A34995,A181478] The 521CC
      genotype is also associated with a marked increase in the risk of developing myopathy, likely
      secondary to increased systemic exposure.[A34994] Other statin drugs impacted by this
      polymorphism include [rosuvastatin], [pitavastatin], [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and
      [pravastatin].[A181460]

      For patients known to have the above-mentioned c.521CC OATP1B1 genotype, a maximum daily dose
      of 20mg of simvastatin is recommended to avoid adverse effects from the increased exposure to
      the drug, such as muscle pain and risk of rhabdomyolysis.[F4658]

      Evidence has also been obtained with other statins such as [rosuvastatin] that concurrent use
      of statins and inhibitors of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) such as elbasvir and
      grazoprevir increased the plasma
      concentration of these statins. Further evidence is needed, however a dose adjustment of
      simvastatin may be necessary. Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include
      [fluvastatin] and [atorvastatin].[A181478]</absorption>

    <name>Verapamil</name>
    <metabolism>Verapamil is extensively metabolized by the liver, with up to 80% of an administered
      dose subject to elimination via pre-systemic metabolism - interestingly, this first-pass
      metabolism appears to clear the S-enantiomer of verapamil much faster than the
      R-enantiomer.[L10478,A415] The remaining parent drug undergoes O-demethylation,
      N-dealkylation, and N-demethylation to a number of different metabolites via the cytochrome
      P450 enzyme system.[A415] Norverapamil, one of the major circulating metabolites, is the
      result of verapamil's N-demethylation via CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5,[A415] and carries
      approximately 20% of the cardiovascular activity of its parent drug.[L10478] The other major
      pathway involved in verapamil metabolism is N-dealkylation via CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 to
      the D-617 metabolite. Both norverapamil and D-617 are further metabolized by other CYP
      isoenzymes to various secondary metabolites. CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 have also been implicated in
      the metabolic pathway of verapamil, albeit to a minor extent.[A415] Minor pathways of
      verapamil metabolism involve its O-demethylation to D-703 via CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C18, and
      to D-702 via CYP2C9 and CYP2C18.[A415]

      Several steps in verapamil's metabolic pathway show stereoselective preference for the
      S-enantiomer of the given substrate, including the generation of the D-620 metabolite by
      CYP3A4/5 and the D-617 metabolite by CYP2C8.[A415]</metabolism>
    <absorption>More than 90% of orally administered verapamil is absorbed - despite this,
      bioavailability ranges only from 20% to 30% due to rapid biotransformation following
      first-pass metabolism in the portal circulation.[L8791] Absorption kinetic parameters are
      largely dependent on the specific formulation of verapamil involved. Immediate-release
      verapamil reaches peak plasma concentrations (i.e. T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) between 1-2
      hours following administration,[L8791] whereas sustained-release formulations tend to have a
      T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; between 6 - 11 hours.[L10478,L10637]

      AUC and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values are similarly dependent upon formulation. Chronic
      administration of immediate-release verapamil every 6 hours resulted in plasma concentrations
      between 125 and 400 ng/mL.[L8791] Steady-state AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-24h&lt;/sub&gt; and
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values for a sustained-release formulation were 1037 ng∙h/ml and
      77.8 ng/mL for the R-isomer and 195 ng∙h/ml and 16.8 ng/mL for the S-isomer,
      respectively.[L10478]

      Interestingly, the absorption kinetics of verapamil are highly stereospecific - following oral
      administration of immediate-release verapamil every 8 hours, the relative systemic
      availability of the S-enantiomer compared to the R-enantiomer was 13% after a single dose and
      18% at steady-state.[L10478]</absorption>

    <metabolism>_In vitro_ study findings suggest that about 75% of the drug is metabolized by

      and the CYP3A4-mediated pathway forms the galantamine-N-oxide.[A182993] Important metabolic
      pathways also include N-demethylation, epimerization, and sulfate conjugation.[A203444] Other
      metabolites include norgalantamine, O-desmethyl-galantamine, O-desmethyl-norgalantamine,

      activities.[A1022]

      Galantamine can also undergo glucuronidation: in one oral radiolabeled drug study in poor and

      galantamine glucuronide 8 hours post-dose. O-demethylation by CYP2D6 becomes prominent in
      patients with who are extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, but unchanged galatamine (39-77%) and

      11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases has been observed,[A187144] this reaction is greatly impaired

      to the metabolism of MPA in addition to other UGT enzymes, which also play a role in MPA
      metabolism. The four major metabolites of MPA are 7-O-MPA-β-glucuronide (MPAG, inactive), MPA
      acyl-glucuronide (AcMPAG), produced by uridine 5ʹ-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGT)

      smaller extent. The kidneys are responsible for about 85% of total furosemide total clearance,
      where about 40% involves biotransformation.[A183563] Two major metabolites of furosemide are
      furosemide glucuronide, which is pharmacologically active, and saluamine (CSA) or
      4-chloro-5-sulfamoylanthranilic acid.[A183281]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Following oral administration, furosemide is absorbed from the gastrointestinal
      tract.[L9659] It displays variable bioavailability from oral dosage forms, ranging from 10 to
      90%.[A31831] The oral bioavailability of furosemide from oral tablets or oral solution is
      about 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug.[L7958]</absorption>

      **Effect of food on absorption**

      Food has been shown to increase absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase in
      absorption with the tablet (about 30%) was noticeably higher than the capsule (~10%). When the
      capsule and tablet were administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about
      80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet [FDA label]. It is therefore advisable to take this
      drug with food for increased absorption, especially in tablet form.</absorption>

    <metabolism>Paroxetine metabolism occurs in the liver and is largely mediated by cytochrome

      The majority of a paroxetine dose is oxidized to a catechol metabolite that is subsequently

      5β-reductase.[A188078,A188075] The 5α-reduced metabolites, including 5α-dihydronorethisterone
      and its derivatives, appear to carry biological activity while the 5β-reduced metabolites
      appear inactive.[A188075] Norethisterone and its metabolites are also extensively conjugated -
      most of the plasmatic metabolites are sulfate conjugates, while most of the urinary
      metabolites are glucuronide conjugates.[A188072,L10307] The major metabolites in plasma are a
      disulfate conjugate of 3α,5α-tetrahydronorethisterone and a monosulfate conjugate of
      3α,5β-tetrahydronorethisterone, while the major metabolite(s) in the urine are comprised of
      glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of 3α,5β-tetrahydronorethisterone.[A188150]
      Norethisterone has also been observed to undergo some degree of metabolism via the cytochrome

      Norethisterone is often formulated as norethisterone acetate, which is completely and rapidly

      1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols are less biologically active than nitroglycerin but they have

    <name>Esomeprazole</name>
    <metabolism>Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
      enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack antisecretory activity. The major part of
      esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and
      desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone
      metabolite. CYP2C19 isoenzyme exhibits polymorphism in the metabolism of esomeprazole, since
      some 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians lack CYP2C19 and are termed Poor
      Metabolizers.[FDA Label] However, the influence of CYP 2C19 polymorphism is less pronounced
      for esomeprazole than for omeprazole.[F4495] At steady state, the ratio of AUC in Poor
      Metabolizers to AUC in the rest of the population (Extensive Metabolizers) is approximately 2.
      Following administration of equimolar doses, the S- and R-isomers are metabolized differently
      by the liver, resulting in higher plasma levels of the S- than of the R-isomer.[FDA Label]

      Nine major urinary metabolites have been detected. The two main metabolites have been
      identified as hydroxyesomeprazole and the corresponding carboxylic acid. Three major
      metabolites have been identified in plasma: the 5-O-desmethyl- and sulphone derivatives and
      hydroxyesomeprazole. The major metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid
      secretion.[F4495]</metabolism>
    <absorption>After oral administration, peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5
      hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a
      three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40
      mg. At repeated once-daily dosing with 40 mg, the systemic bioavailability is approximately
      90% compared to 64% after a single dose of 40 mg. The mean exposure (AUC) to esomeprazole
      increases from 4.32 μmol*hr/L on Day 1 to 11.2 μmol*hr/L on Day 5 after 40 mg once daily
      dosing. The AUC after administration of a single 40 mg dose of Esomeprazole is decreased by
      43% to 53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at
      least one hour before meals.[FDA Label]

      _Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials:_

      Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily was given in combination with [DB01211] 500 mg twice
      daily and [DB01060] 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days to 17 healthy male and female subjects. The
      mean steady state AUC and Cmax of esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively during
      triple combination therapy compared to treatment with esomeprazole alone. The observed
      increase in esomeprazole exposure during co-administration with clarithromycin and amoxicillin
      is not expected to produce significant safety concerns.</absorption>

    <name>Scopolamine</name>
    <metabolism>Little is known about the metabolism of scopolamine in humans, although many
      metabolites have been detected in animal studies.[A228758] In general, scopolamine is
      primarily metabolized in the liver, and the primary metabolites are various glucuronide and
      sulphide conjugates.[A228758, A228763] Although the enzymes responsible for scopolamine
      metabolism are unknown, _in vitro_ studies have demonstrated oxidative demethylation linked to
      CYP3A subfamily activity, and scopolamine pharmacokinetics were significantly altered by
      coadministration with grapefruit juice, suggesting that CYP3A4 is responsible for at least
      some of the oxidative demethylation.[A228758, A228923]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The pharmacokinetics of scopolamine differ substantially between different dosage
      routes. Oral administration of 0.5 mg scopolamine in healthy volunteers produced a
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.54 ± 0.1 ng/mL, a t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 23.5 ± 8.2
      min, and an AUC of 50.8 ± 1.76 ng\*min/mL; the absolute bioavailability is low at 13 ± 1%,
      presumably because of first-pass metabolism.[A228758] By comparison, IV infusion of 0.5 mg
      scopolamine over 15 minutes resulted in a C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.00 ± 0.43 ng/mL, a
      t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.0 min, and an AUC of 369.4 ± 2.2 ng\*min/mL.[A228758]

      Other dose forms have also been tested. Subcutaneous administration of 0.4 mg scopolamine
      resulted in a C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 3.27 ng/mL, a t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 14.6
      min, and an AUC of 158.2 ng\*min/mL. Intramuscular administration of 0.5 scopolamine resulted
      in a C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.96 ± 0.17 ng/mL, a t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 18.5 ±
      4.7 min, and an AUC of 81.3 ± 11.2 ng\*min/mL. Absorption following intranasal administration
      was found to be rapid, whereby 0.4 mg of scopolamine resulted in a C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;
      of 1.68 ± 0.23 ng/mL, a t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.2 ± 3 min, and an AUC of 167 ± 20
      ng\*min/mL; intranasal scopolamine also had a higher bioavailability than that of oral
      scopolamine at 83 ± 10%.[A228758]

      Due to dose-dependent adverse effects, the transdermal patch was developed to obtain
      therapeutic plasma concentrations over a longer period of time. Following patch application,
      scopolamine becomes detectable within four hours and reaches a peak concentration
      (t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration is 87 pg/mL,
      and the total levels of free and conjugated scopolamine reach 354 pg/mL.[L31578]</absorption>

    <name>Estradiol</name>
    <metabolism>Exogenously administered estrogens are metabolized in the same fashion as endogenous
      estrogens. Metabolic transformation occurs primarily in the liver and intestine.[A190393]
      Estradiol is metabolized to estrone, and both are converted to estriol, which is later
      excreted in the urine. Sulfate and glucuronide conjugation estrogens also take place in the
      liver. Biliary secretion of metabolic conjugates are released into the intestine, and estrogen
      hydrolysis in the gut occurs, followed by reabsorption.[A12102,L11530] The CYP3A4 hepatic
      cytochrome enzyme is heavily involved in the metabolism of estradiol. CYP1A2 also plays a
      role.[A14754,A38927]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The absorption of several formulations of estradiol is described below:

      Oral tablets and injections

      First-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract rapidly breaks down estradiol tablets
      before entering the systemic circulation.[A12102,L11485] The bioavailability of oral estrogens
      is said to be 2-10% due to significant first-pass effects.[A12102] The esterification of
      estradiol improves the administration (such as with estradiol valerate) or to sustain release
      from intramuscular depot injections (including estradiol cypionate[L11491]) via higher
      lipophilicity.[T84] After absorption, the esters are cleaved, which leads to the release of
      endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol.

      Transdermal preparations

      The transdermal preparations slowly release estradiol through intact skin, which sustains
      circulating levels of estradiol during a 1 week period of time. Notably, the bioavailability
      of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than after oral
      administration. Transdermal estradiol avoids first pass metabolism effects that reduce
      bioavailability. Administration via the buttock leads to a Cmax of about 174 pg/mL compared to
      147 pg/mL via the abdomen.[L11530]

      Spray preparations

      After daily administration, the spray formulations of estradiol reach steady state within 7-8
      days. After 3 sprays daily, Cmax is about 54 pg/mL with a Tmax of 20 hours. AUC is about 471
      pg•hr/mL.[L11488]

      Vaginal ring and cream preparations

      Estradiol is efficiently absorbed through the mucous membranes of the vagina. The vaginal
      administration of estrogens evades first-pass metabolism. Tmax after vaginal ring delivery
      ranges from 0.5 to 1 hour. Cmax is about 63 pg/mL.[L11494] The vaginal cream preparation has a
      Cmax of estradiol (a component of Premarin vaginal estrogen conjugate cream) was a Cmax of
      12.8 ± 16.6 pg/mL, Tmax of 8.5 ± 6.2 hours, with an AUC of 231 ± 285 pg•hr/mL.[L11662]

    <metabolism>Naproxen is heavily metabolized in the liver and undergoes both Phase I and Phase II
      metabolism.[L6582][L6583][A179197] The first step involves demethylation of naproxen via CYP
      1A2, 2C8, and 2C9[A179191][A38985]. Both naproxen and desmethylnaproxen proceed to Phase II
      metabolism; however, desmethylnaproxen can form both acyl and phenolic glucoronide products,
      while naproxen only produces the acyl glucuronide.[A179191][A179197] The acyl glucuronidation
      process involves UGT 1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A7, 1A9, 1A10 and 2B7, while phenolic glucuronidation is
      catalyzed by UGT 1A1, 1A7,1A9, and 1A10.[A179191] Desmethylnaproxen also undergoes sulphation
      which is mediated by SULT 1A1, 1B1 and 1E1.[A179197]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Naproxen is available as a free acid and sodium salt.[A179098] At comparable doses,
      (naproxen 500 mg = naproxen sodium 550 mg) they differ slightly in their rates of absorption,
      but otherwise they are therapeutically and pharmacologically equivalent.[A179098] Naproxen
      sodium achieves a peak plasma concentration after 1 hour, while peak plasma concentration is
      observed after 2 hours with naproxen (free acid).[A179098] There are no differences between
      the 2 forms in the post-absorption phase pharmacokinetics.[A179098] The difference in initial
      absorption should be considered when treating acute pain, since naproxen sodium may offer a
      quicker onset of action.[A179098]

      The mean Cmax for the various formulations (immediate release, enteric coated, controlled
      release etc.) of naproxen are comparable and range from 94 mcg/mL to 97.4
      mcg/mL.[L6582][L6583] In one pharmacokinetic study, the mean Tmax of naproxen 500 mg
      (immediate release) given every 12 hours over 5 days was 3 hours, compared to a mean Tmax of 5
      hours for Naprelan 1000 mg (controlled release) given every 24 hours over 5 days.[L6582] In
      this same study, the AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-24hr&lt;/sub&gt; was 1446mcgxhr/mL for naproxen immediate
      release and 1448 mcgxhr/mL for the controlled release formulation.[L6582] A separate study
      comparing the pharmacokinetics of Naprosyn tablets and EC-Naprosyn observed the following
      values: Tmax and AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-12hrs&lt;/sub&gt; of EC-Naprosyn were 4 hours and 845
      mcgxhr/mL respectively, and Tmax and AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-12hrs&lt;/sub&gt; values of Naprosyn were
      1.9 hours and 767 mcgxhr/mL respectively.[L6583]

      When given in combination with sumatriptan the Cmax of naproxen is roughly 36% lower compared
      to naproxen sodium 550 mg tablets, and the median Tmax is 5 hours.[L7309]

      Based on the AUC and Cmax of naproxen, Vimovo (naproxen/esomeprazole combination product) and
      enteric-coated naproxen may be considered bioequivalent.[L7312]

      Overall, naproxen is rapidly and completely absorbed when administered orally and
      rectally.[A179110][A179098] Food may contribute to a delay in the absorption of orally
      administered naproxen, but will not affect the extent of absorption.[A179098]</absorption>

    <name>Pentoxifylline</name>
    <metabolism>Pentoxifylline (PTX) metabolism is incompletely understood. There are seven known
      metabolites (M1 through M7), although only M1, M4, and M5 are detected in plasma at
      appreciable levels, following the general pattern M5 &gt; M1 &gt; PTX &gt; M4.[A226415,
      L30300] As PTX apparent clearance is higher than hepatic blood flow and the AUC ratio of M1 to
      PTX is not appreciably different in cirrhotic patients, it is clear that erythrocytes are the
      main site of PTX-M1 interconversion. However, the reaction likely occurs in the liver as
      well.[A226550, A31221, A226585] PTX is reduced in an NADPH-dependent manner by unknown an
      unidentified carbonyl reductase to form either [lisofylline] (the (R)-M1 enantiomer) or
      (S)-M1; the reaction is stereoselective, producing (S)-M1 exclusively in liver cytosol, 85%
      (S)-M1 in liver microsomes, and a ratio of 0.010-0.025 R:S-M1 after IV or oral dosing in
      humans.[A31221, A226585] Although both (R)- and (S)-M1 can be oxidized back into PTX, (R)-M1
      can also give rise to M2 and M3 in liver microsomes.[A31221, A226585] _In vitro_ studies
      suggest that CYP1A2 is at least partly responsible for the conversion of [lisofylline]
      ((R)-M1) back into PTX.[A31220] Unlike the reversible oxidation/reduction of PTX and its M1
      metabolites, M4 and M5 are formed via irreversible oxidation of PTX in the liver.[A226545,
      A226560, A226565, A31221, A226585] Studies in mice recapitulating the PTX-ciprofloxacin drug
      reaction suggest that CYP1A2 is responsible for the formation of M6 from PTX and of M7 from
      M1, both through de-methylation at position 7.[A184829] In general, metabolites M2, M3, and M6
      are formed at very low levels in mammals.[A226545]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Oral pentoxifylline (PTX) is almost completely absorbed but has low bioavailability
      of 20-30% due to extensive first-pass metabolism; three of the seven known metabolites, M1,
      M4, and M5 are present in plasma and appear soon after dosing.[A226560, A226565, L30300]
      Single oral doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg of pentoxifylline in healthy males produced a mean
      t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.29-0.41 h, a mean C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 272-1607
      ng/mL, and a mean AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-∞&lt;/sub&gt; of 193-1229 ng\*h/mL; corresponding ranges for
      metabolites 1, 4, and 5 were 0.72-1.15, 114-2753, and 189-7057.[A226545] Single administration
      of a 400 mg extended-release tablet resulted in a heightened t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of
      2.08 ± 1.16 h, lowered C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 55.33 ± 22.04 ng/mL, and a comparable
      AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; of 516 ± 165 ng\*h/mL; all these parameters were increased in
      cirrhotic patients.[A226550]

      Smoking was associated with a decrease in the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and
      AUC&lt;sub&gt;steady-state&lt;/sub&gt; of metabolite M1 but did not dramatically affect the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of pentoxifylline or other measured metabolites.[A226555] Renal
      impairment increases the mean C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, AUC, and ratio to parent compound
      AUC of metabolites M4 and M5, but has no significant effect on PTX or M1
      pharmacokinetics.[A226560] Finally, similar to cirrhotic patients, the
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of PTX and its metabolites are
      increased in patients with varying degrees of chronic heart failure.[A226565]

      Overall, metabolites M1 and M5 exhibit plasma concentrations roughly five and eight times
      greater than PTX, respectively. PTX and M1 pharmacokinetics are approximately dose-dependent,
      while those of M5 are not. Food intake before PTX ingestion delays time to peak plasma
      concentrations but not overall absorption. Extended-release forms of PTX extend the
      t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; to between two and four hours but also serves to ameliorate peaks
      and troughs in plasma concentration over time.[L30300]</absorption>

    <name>Indapamide</name>
    <metabolism>As a result of extensive metabolism in the liver, the majority of indapamide
      excreted is metabolized, with only 7% remaining unchanged.[A203663] In humans, as many as 19
      distinct indapamide metabolites may be produced, although not all have been
      identified.[A203627,A203663]

      There are several metabolic routes through which indapamide may be metabolized, and CYP3A4 is
      the main enzyme involved in the corresponding hydroxylation, carboxylation, and
      dehydrogenation reactions.[A34415]

      Indapamide can undergo dehydrogenation to form M5, then oxidation to form M4, then further
      hydroxylation at the indole moiety to form M2.[A17553] These reactions are facilitated by
      CYP3A4.[A17553]

      Another route of metabolism occurs when indapamide is first hydroxylated to M1 by
      CYP3A4.[A17553] M1 then undergoes dehydrogenation to form M3 and is further oxidized to form
      M2.[A17553] Hydroxylation of indapamide’s indole moiety is thought to form the major
      metabolite (M1), which is less pharmacologically active compared to its parent compound
      according to animal studies.[A203663]

      Indapamide may also undergo epoxidation via CYP3A4 to form a reactive epoxide
      intermediate.[A17553] The unstable epoxide intermediate may then undergo dihydroxylation via
      microsomal epoxide hydrolase to form M6, or glutathione conjugation to form M7.[A17553]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The bioavailability of indapamide is virtually complete after an oral dose and is
      unaffected by food or antacids.[A203663,A203519] Indapamide is highly lipid-soluble due to its
      indoline moiety - a characteristic that likely explains why indapamide’s renal clearance makes
      up less than 10% of its total systemic clearance.[A203627,A203663,A203519] The Tmax occurs
      approximately 2.3 hours after oral administration.[A203663] The Cmax and
      AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-24&lt;/sub&gt; values are 263 ng/mL and 2.95 ug/hr/mL, respectively.[A203663]</absorption>

      N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam [F3157,
      F3160]. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam [F3157,
      F3160]. Temazepam and oxazepam are further largely eliminated by way of conjugation to
      glucuronic acid via glucuronidation [F3157, F3160].

      Furthermore, oxidation of diazepam is mediated by cytochrome P450 isozymes; formation of
      desmethyl-diazepam mainly by CYP2C19 and CYP3A and 3-hydroxy-diazepam (temazepam) and oxazepam
      by CYP3A. Because CYP2C19 is polymorphic, extensive metabolizers (EMs), and poor metabolizers
      (PMs) of diazepam can be distinguished [F3157, F3160]. PMs of diazepam showed significantly
      lower clearance (12 vs 26 mL/min) and longer elimination half-life (88 vs 41 h) of diazepam
      than EMs after a single oral dose [F3157, F3160]. Also, PMs had lower clearance, higher AUC
      and longer elimination half-life of desmethyl-diazepam [F3157, F3160].</metabolism>
    <absorption>After oral administration, it is considered that diazepam is rapidly and completely
      absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract as &gt;90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average
      time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 – 1.5 hours with a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours
      [F3157, F3160, L5188].

      Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal [F3157]. In the
      presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 minutes when
      fasting [F3157]. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations
      to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting [F3157].
      This results in an average decrease in Cmax of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range
      15% to 50%) when administered with food [F3157].</absorption>

    <name>Loperamide</name>
    <metabolism>Loperamide is extensively metabolized. The primary metabolic pathway is oxidative
      N-demethylation mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, to form N-demethyl loperamide. CYP2B6 and
      CYP2D6 play a minor role in loperamide N-demethylation.[L42790] Metabolites of loperamide are

    <absorption>Loperamide is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; however, it undergoes
      extensive first-pass metabolism to form metabolites that are excreted in the bile. Therefore,
      little loperamide actually reaches the systemic circulation.[A251615] The drug bioavailability
      is less than 1%.[A251610]

      Following oral administration of a 2 mg capsule of loperamide, plasma concentrations of

    <name>Ranitidine</name>
    <metabolism>The major metabolite in the urine is N-oxide, which represents less than 4% of the
      dose. Other metabolites of ranitidine include S-oxide (1%) and desmethyl ranitidine
      (1%).[L10818,L10923] The feces contain the remainder of the excreted ranitidine dose. Liver
      dysfunction has been shown to cause small, but clinically insignificant, changes in various
      ranitidine pharmacokinetic parameters.[L10818]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Ranitidine is rapidly absorbed with peak concentrations reached within 1-3 hours
      after administration, and varying greatly among patients. Bioavailability is about 50%-60% due
      to hepatic metabolism.[A188817,L10923] In a pharmacokinetic study of healthy males, the AUC
      0-infinity was about
      2,488.6 ng x h/mL and the median Tmax was 2.83 hours.[A188829] Food or antacids have limited
      effects on absorption. One clinical study found that the administration of a potent antacid
      (150 mmol) in subjects in the fasted state led to decreased absorption of ranitidine.[L10818]</absorption>

    <name>Tacrolimus</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of tacrolimus is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4 and secondarily by
      CYP3A5.[A38786,L8162] Tacrolimus is metabolized into 8 metabolites: 13-demethyl tacrolimus,
      31-demethyl tacrolimus, 15-demethyl tacrolimus, 12-hydroxy tacrolimus, 15,31-didemethyl
      tacrolimus, 13,31-didemethyl tacrolimus, 13,15-didemethyl tacrolimus, and a final metabolite
      involving O-demethylation and the formation of a fused ring.[A38786] The major metabolite
      identified in incubations with human liver microsomes is 13-demethyl tacrolimus.[L8162] In in
      vitro studies, a 31-demethyl metabolite has been reported to have the same activity as
      tacrolimus.[L8162]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Absorption of tacrolimus from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration
      is incomplete and variable. The absolute bioavailability in adult kidney transplant patients
      is 17±10%; in adults liver transplant patients is 22±6%; in healthy subjects is 18±5%. The
      absolute bioavailability in pediatric liver transplant patients was 31±24%. Tacrolimus maximum
      blood concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) appeared to increase in a
      dose-proportional fashion in 18 fasted healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 3,
      7, and 10 mg. When given without food, the rate and extent of absorption were the greatest.
      The time of the meal also affected bioavailability. When given immediately after a meal, mean
      Cmax was reduced 71%, and mean AUC was reduced 39%, relative to the fasted condition. When
      administered 1.5 hours following the meal, mean Cmax was reduced 63%, and mean AUC was reduced

    <name>Loteprednol etabonate</name>
    <metabolism>Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is readily and extensively metabolized to two inactive
      metabolites, PJ-90 (Δ1-cortienic acid) and PJ-91 (Δ1-cortienic acid etabonate) [FDA Label,
      F1467]. Metabolism occurs locally in ocular tissues, and to the extent that loteprednol
      etabonate reaches the systemic circulation, likely the liver and other tissues into which it
      distributes [F1467].

      In particular, studies have demonstrated that LE (chloromethyl
      17alpha-ethoxycarbonyloxy-11beta-hydroxy-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene) is rapidly hydrolyzed at the
      location of its 17beta-chloromethyl ester function by paraoxonase 1 in human plasma at the
      site of administration at the level of the affected eye tissue to the 17beta-carboxylate PJ-91
      metabolite and PJ-90 metabolite [A38681, A38693]. Both metabolites are considered inactive
      [FDA Label, A38693, A38693].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Loteprednol etabonate (LE) demonstrates good ocular permeation properties as it is
      lipid soluble, allowing the agent to penetrate into cells with relative ease [FDA Label,
      A1312].

      Results from the ocular administration of loteprednol in normal, healthy volunteers have shown
      that there are low or undetectable concentrations of either unchanged material or its
      metabolite [L4539]. Following twice-daily unilateral topical ocular dosing of LE for 14 days
      in healthy subjects, the plasma concentrations of loteprednol etabonate were below the limit
      of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all time points [FDA Label]. These finds suggest that limited, if
      any, systemic absorption of LE occurs [L4539].</absorption>

    <name>Guaifenesin</name>
    <metabolism>After the oral administration of 400 mg guaifenesin, the agent experiences rapid
      hydrolysis (more than 60% of the dose hydrolyzed over a range of seven hours) with
      β-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid found as the major urinary metabolite but no parent drug
      detectable in the urine [A177676, L6100]. Moreover, it has been observed that guaifenesin also
      experiences both oxidation and demethylation [A177676]. In particular, the medication is
      quickly metabolized hepatically by way of oxidation to β-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid
      [A177676]. Furthermore, guaifenesin is also demethylated by O-demethylase in liver microsomes
      to the point where about 40% of an administered dose is excreted as this metabolite in the
      urine within 3 hours [A177676]. In fact, O-demethylase appears to be the primary enzyme for
      the metabolism of guaifenesin and the primary metabolites of the substance are
      β-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-lactic acid and the demethylated hydroxyguaifenesin, both of which are
      themselves inactive moieties [A177676].</metabolism>

      active ingredient in the intramuscular formulation, is hydrolyzed to flupentixol.[L31808]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Following oral administration, flupentixol is readily absorbed from the
      gastrointestinal tract, with oral bioavailability of about 40%. T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;
      ranges from three to eight hours. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved in about seven days
      and following once-daily oral administration of 5 mg flupentixol, the mean minimum
      steady-state level was about 1.7 ng/mL (3.9 nmol/L).[L31808]

      From the site of intramuscular injection, esterified flupentixol diffuses slowly from the oil
      solution and is slowly released into the extracellular fluid and the circulation to be
      distributed to different tissues. Peak drug concentrations are reached between four and seven
      days following intramuscular injection. Intramuscularly administered flupentixol is detectable

      pharmacologically inactive. Sirolimus also undergoes counter-transport from enterocytes of the
      small intestine into the gut lumen.[L19809]</metabolism>
    <absorption>In adult renal transplant patients with low- to moderate-immunologic risk, oral

      oral solution and 15.0 ± 4.9 ng/mL for oral tablets. The t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 2.1 ±
      0.8 hours for oral solution and 3.5 ± 2.4 hours for oral tablets. In healthy subjects, the
      t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is one hour. In a multi-dose study, steady-state was reached six
      days following repeated twice-daily administration without an initial loading dose, with the
      average trough concentration of sirolimus increased approximately 2- to 3-fold. It is
      suspected that a loading dose of three times the maintenance dose will provide near
      steady-state concentrations within one day in most patients.[L19809]

      The systemic availability of sirolimus is approximately 14%. In healthy subjects, the mean
      bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the tablet is approximately 27% higher
      relative to the solution. Sirolimus tablets are not bioequivalent to the solution; however,
      clinical equivalence has been demonstrated at the 2 mg dose level. Sirolimus concentrations,

    <name>Ondansetron</name>
    <metabolism>In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human
      hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In
      terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role [F3178, F3181,
      F3184]. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron,
      it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency) will be
      compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron
      clearance [F3178, F3181, F3184].

      Following oral or IV administration, ondansetron is extensively metabolised and excreted in
      the urine and faeces [F3178, F3181, F3184]. In humans, less than 10% of the dose is excreted
      unchanged in the urine [F3178, F3181, F3184]. The major urinary metabolites are glucuronide
      conjugates (45%), sulphate conjugates (20%) and hydroxylation products (10%) [F3178, F3181,
      F3184]. The primary metabolic pathway is subsequently hydroxylation on the indole ring
      followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Although some
      nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at
      concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron
      [F3178, F3181, F3184].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Ondansetron is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes some limited
      first-pass metabolism [F3178]. Mean bioavailability in healthy subjects, following
      administration of a single 8-mg tablet, was recorded as being approximately 56% to 60% [F3178,
      F3181, F3184]. Bioavailability is also slightly enhanced by the presence of food [F3178].
      Ondansetron systemic exposure does not increase proportionately to dose [F3178]. The AUC from
      a 16-mg tablet was 24% greater than predicted from an 8-mg tablet dose [F3178]. This may
      reflect some reduction of first-pass metabolism at higher oral doses [F3178].</absorption>

    <name>Bimatoprost</name>
    <metabolism>Bimatoprost is hydrolyzed to its active form, bimatoprost acid, in the eye.[L6913]
      Bimatoprost undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation, and glucuronidation after it is systemically
      absorbed, and this leads to the production of various metabolites.[L6877] In vitro studies
      show that CYP3A4 is an enzyme that participates in the metabolism of bimatoprost. Despite
      this, many enzymes and pathways metabolize bimatoprost, therefore, no significant drug-drug
      interactions are likely to occur.[L6892] Glucuronidated metabolites comprise most of the
      excreted drug product in the blood, urine, and feces in rats.[L6892]</metabolism>
    <absorption>This drug is absorbed systemically when administered to the eye. A study was
      performed on 15 healthy volunteers and bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% was administered
      once daily for 14 days. The mean Cmax was approximately 0.08 ng/mL and AUC0-24hr was
      approximately 0.09 on days 7 and 14 of the study.[L6877] By 10 minutes, peak blood
      concentration was achieved. Bimatoprost was not detectable at 1.5 hours after administration
      in most subjects. The maximum blood concentration in a study of 6 healthy volunteers was
      determined to be 12.2 ng/mL. Steady state was reached in the first week of dosing.[L6877]

      One drug label mentions that onset of decreased intraocular pressure occurs approximately 4
      hours after the first administration and the peak effect occurs in the range of 8-12 hours.
      Bimatoprost effects may last up to 24 hours.[L6898]</absorption>

    <name>Quinidine</name>
    <metabolism>Quinidine is mainly metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes,
      specifically CYP3A4. The major metabolite of quinidine is 3-hydroxy-quinidine, which has a
      volume of distribution larger than quinidine and an elimination half-life of about 12
      hours.[L42420,L3719] Non-clinical and clinical studies suggest that 3-hydroxy-quinidine has
      approximately half the antiarrhythmic activity of quinidine; therefore, this metabolite is
      partly responsible for the effects detected with the chronic use of quinidine.[L42420,L3719]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The absolute bioavailability of quinidine sulfate is approximately 70%, but it
      ranges from 45% to 100%. The less-than-complete quinidine sulfate bioavailability is a result
      of first-pass metabolism in the liver.[L42420] In contrast, the absolute bioavailability of
      quinidine gluconate ranges from 70% to 80%, and relative to quinidine sulfate, quinidine from
      quinidine gluconate has a bioavailability of 1.03.[L3719] The t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of
      quinidine sulfate extended-release tablets is approximately 6 h[L42420], while the
      t&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of quinidine gluconate goes from 3 to 5 h.[L3719] The peak serum
      concentration reached with immediate-release quinidine sulfate is delayed for about an hour
      when taken with food. Furthermore, the ingestion of grapefruit juice may decrease the rate of
      absorption of quinidine.[L42420,L3719]</absorption>

    <name>Zonisamide</name>
    <metabolism>Zonisamide metabolites are generated mainly by principally reductive and conjugative
      mechanisms. Oxidation reactions play a minor role in the metabolism of zonisamide.[A1383]
      Zonisamide is metabolized by N-acetyl-transferases to form N-acetyl zonisamide and reduced to
      form the open ring metabolite, 2–sulfamoylacetylphenol (SMAP). The reduction of zonisamide to
      SMAP is mediated by CYP3A4.[A1379,A1383,L42530,L42535] Zonisamide does not induce liver
      enzymes or its own metabolism.[A1379]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Between 200 and 400 mg, zonisamide follows a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic
      profile.[L42530,L42535] At concentrations higher than 800 mg, the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;
      and AUC increase in a disproportional manner, possibly due to zonisamide binding red blood
      cells. In healthy volunteers given 200 to 400 mg of zonisamide orally, peak plasma
      concentrations (C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) range between 2 and 5 µg/mL and are reached
      within 2–6 hours (T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;).[L42530] In healthy volunteers given 100 mg of
      zonisamide oral suspension, the T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; ranged from 0.5 to 5
      hours.[L42535] Zonisamide has a high oral bioavailability (95%).[A1383] The
      T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of zonisamide was delayed by food intake (4-6 hours); however,
      food has no effect on its bioavailability. Steady state is achieved 14 days after a stable

      1-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-2-hydroxy methyl-5-nitroimidazole, is considered the major active
      metabolite.[A181045,A181144] Unchanged metronidazole is found in the plasma along with small
      amounts of its 2- hydroxymethyl metabolite. Several metabolites of metronidazole are found in
      the urine. They are primarily a product of side-chain oxidation in addition to glucuronide
      conjugation. Only 20% of the dose found in the urine is accounted for by unchanged
      metronidazole.[L7432] The two main oxidative metabolites of metronidazole are hydroxy and
      acetic acid metabolites.[A181042,A181051]</metabolism>
    <absorption>After the intravenous infusion of a 1.5g dose, peak concentration was reached within
      1 hour and was peak level of 30-40 mg/L.[L7432] When a multiple-dose regimen of 500mg three
      times a day administered intravenously, steady-state concentrations were achieved within about
      3 days and peak concentration was measured at 26 mg/L.[L7432]
      When administered orally in the tablet form, metronidazole is absorbed entirely absorbed,
      showing a bioavailability of greater than 90%.[A181045] One resource indicates that Cmax after
      a single oral dose of 500mg metronidazole ranges from 8 to 13 mg/L, with a Tmax of 25 minutes

      and the 10-hydroxyl derivative comprising 2% and &lt;1%, respectively.[L32283] Nor-ketotifen
      appears to be equally as active as its parent drug,[L32283] though the clinical relevance of
      this is unclear given the relatively small proportion in which nor-ketotifen is found in the

      Formation of the N-glucuronide metabolite is carried out by several UGT enzymes, including

      absorbed from the oral mucosa directly into systemic circulation.[A187430]

      Clinical pharmacokinetic studies found that there was wide inter-patient variability in the
      sublingual absorption of buprenorphine and naloxone, but within subjects the variability was
      low. Both Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine increased in a linear fashion with the increase in
      dose (in the range of 4 to 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional.
      Buprenorphine combination with naloxone (2mg/0.5mg) provided in sublingual tablets

      Acetylsalicylic acid is hydrolyzed in the plasma to salicylic acid. Plasma concentrations of

      4-8 hours after ingestion of a single dose. Salicylic acid was measured at 24 hours following
      a single dose of extended-release acetylsalicylic acid [F4405].

      Salicylate is mainly metabolized in the liver, although other tissues may also be involved in
      this process [FDA label]. The major metabolites of acetylsalicylic acid are salicylic acid,
      salicyluric acid, the ether or phenolic glucuronide and the ester or acyl glucuronide. A small
      portion is converted to gentisic acid and other hydroxybenzoic acids [FDA label].

      label].

      **Detailed absorption information**

      When ingested orally, acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly absorbed in both the stomach and
      proximal small intestine. The non-ionized acetylsalicylic acid passes through the stomach
      lining by passive diffusion. Ideal absorption of salicylate in the stomach occurs in the pH
      range of 2.15 - 4.10. Intestinal absorption of acetylsalicylic acid occurs at a much faster
      rate. At least half of the ingested dose is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in the first-hour
      post-ingestion by esterases found in the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma salicylate
      concentrations occur between 1-2 hours post-administration [FDA label].</absorption>

      glucuronide conjugation reaction in the small intestine and liver to form its main phenolic
      metabolite, ezetimibe glucuronide. The main human liver and/or intestinal uridine
      5′-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes responsible for the glucuronidation
      of ezetimibe were shown to be UGT1A1, 1A3, and 2B15 _in vitro_.[A15202] Minimal phase I
      reaction involving oxidation of ezetimibe also occurs to form SCH 57871, and human jejunum
      microsomes also produced trace levels of a benzylic glucuronide (SCH 488128).[A15202]
      Ezetimibe glucuronide accounts for 80-90% of the total circulating compound in plasma, and
      retains some pharmacological activity in inhibiting intestinal cholesterol uptake.[L11347] In
      humans, ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide constitutes approximately 93% of the total drug in
      plasma.[L11347] Plasma concentration-time profiles exhibit multiple peaks, suggestive of

      administered alongside a high-fat meal.[L11347] The true bioavailability of ezetimibe cannot

      pathways include sulfate conjugation of the parent drug and deformylation of the parent drug

      O-demethylation following by glucuronidation at the phenolic hydroxyl group.[L10986,A189606]
      _In vitro_ studies of formoterol disposition indicate that O-demethylation of formoterol
      involves a number of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2A6) and
      glucuronidation involves a number of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes (UGT1A1, UGT1A8,

    <name>Mycophenolic acid</name>
    <metabolism>Mycophenolic acid is mainly metabolized by glucuronyl transferase to form
      glucuronidated metabolites. Mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG), the major metabolite of
      mycophenolic acid, does not display pharmacological activity. However, the acyl glucuronide
      minor metabolite has a pharmacological activity similar to mycophenolic acid. The AUC ratio of
      mycophenolic acid:MPAG:acyl glucuronide is approximately 1:24:0.28 at a steady state.[L42165]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Between 360 mg and 2,160 mg, mycophenolic acid follows a linear and
      dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile. The enteric-coating of mycophenolic acid tablets
      prevents release under acidic conditions (stomach, pH &lt; 5). However, enteric-coated
      mycophenolic acid tablets are highly soluble in neutral pH conditions such as those in the
      intestine.[L42165] In renal transplant patients, the median delay
      (T&lt;sub&gt;lag&lt;/sub&gt;) in the rise of mycophenolic acid concentration ranged between
      0.25 and 1.25 hours, and the T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; ranged between 1.5 and 2.75 hours.
      Adult renal transplant patients on cyclosporine given mycophenolic acid had a

      transplant patients had a C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and AUC 33% and 18% higher than the ones
      detected in adults.[L42165]

      In stable renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporine, the gastrointestinal absorption
      and absolute bioavailability of delayed-release tablets of mycophenolic acid were 93% and 72%,
      respectively.[L42165] Following the administration of a high-fat meal (55 g fat, 1000
      calories), the AUC of mycophenolic acid (enteric-coated tablets, 720 mg) was comparable to the
      one detected during fasting. However, a high-fat meal can lead to a 33% decrease of the

    <metabolism>The major metabolite of ketoconazole appears to be M2, an end product resulting from
      oxidation of the imidazole moiety.[A181868] CYP3A4 is known to be the primary contributor to
      this reaction with some contribution from CYP2D6. Other metabolites resulting from CYP3A4
      mediated oxidation of the imidazole moiety include M3, M4, and M5. Ketoconazole may also
      undergo N-deacetylation to M14, , alkyl oxidation to M7, N-oxidation to M13, or aromatic
      hydroxylation to M8, or hydroxylation to M9. M9 may further undergo oxidation of the hydroxyl
      to form M12, N-dealkylation to form M10 with a subsequent N-dealkylation to M15, or may form
      an iminium ion. No metabolites are known to be active however oxidation metabolites of M14
      have been implicated in cytotoxicity.</metabolism>
    <absorption>Ketoconazole requires an acidic environment to become soluble in water.[A181805] At
      pH values above 3 it becomes increasingly insoluble with about 10% entering solution in 1 h.
      At pH less than 3 dissolution is 85% complete in 5 min and entirely complete within 30 min. A

      The M4, M5, and M7 metabolites are all hydroxylated to become the M1 metabolite, which is then
      oxidized to the M2 metabolite.[A415,A181114] The M4 metabolite can also be oxidized to the M6
      metabolite before hydroxylation to the M2 metabolite.[A415,A181114] Finally, the minor
      metabolite SR 49498 is generated from irbesartan by an unknown mechanism.[A415,A181114]</metabolism>

    <name>Thalidomide</name>
    <metabolism>Thalidomide appears to undergo primarily non-enzymatic hydrolysis in plasma to
      multiple metabolites, as the four amide bonds in thalidomide allow for rapid hydrolysis under
      physiological pH. [A246130]

      Evidences for enzymatic metabolism of thalidomide is mixed, as _in vitro_ studies using rat
      liver microsome have detected 5-hydroxythalidomide (5-OH), a monohydroxylated metabolite of
      thalidomide catalyzed by the CYP2C19 enzyme, and the addition of [omeprazole], a CYP2C19
      inhibitor, inhibits the metabolism of thalidomide. [A246130] 5-hydroxythalidomide (5-OH) has
      also been detected in the plasma of 32% of androgen-independent prostate cancer patients
      undergoing oral thalidomide treatment.[A246130] However, significant interspecies difference
      in thalidomide metabolism has been noted, potentially signifying that animals like rats and
      rabbits rely on enzymatic metabolism of thalidomide more than human.[A246130]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The absolute bioavailability has not yet been characterized in human subjects due to
      its poor aqueous solubility. The mean time to peak plasma concentrations
      (T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) ranged from 2.9 to 5.7 hours following a single dose from 50 to
      400 mg. Patients with Hansen&amp;rsquo;s disease may have an increased bioavailability of
      thalidomide, although the clinical significance of this is unknown. [L41235]

      Due to its low aqueous solubility and thus low dissolution is the gastrointestinal tract,
      thalidomide's absorption is slow, with a t&lt;sub&gt;lag&lt;/sub&gt; of 20-40 min. Therefore,
      thalidomide exhibits absorption rate-limited pharmacokinetics or "flip-flop" phenomenon.

      after absorption. This finding is supported as they were found in one order of magnitude
      higher in concentration when compared to the original form.[A32914] Ergoloid mesylate seems to
      have a very low absorption of only 25%. From this absorption by the GI tract, approximately
      50% of the absorbed dose is eliminated by first-pass metabolism. After absorption, the maximal
      plasma concentration is attained after 3-4 hours and the oral bioavailability is very
      low.[T53] Simultaneous food ingestion has no effect on the extent of absorption but it does
      lower the absorption rate.[A32937] To know more about the individual components of the

    <name>Ibuprofen</name>
    <metabolism>Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and biotransformed in the liver to the formation of
      major metabolites which are the hydroxylated and carboxylated derivatives.[A39092] As soon as
      it is absorbed, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive enantiomeric conversion (53-65%) to the
      more active S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase.[A39194]
      Ibuprofen metabolism can be divided in phase I which is represented by the hydroxylation of
      the isobutyl chains for the formation of 2 or 3-hydroxy derivatives followed by oxidation to
      2-carboxy-ibuprofen and p-carboxy-2-propionate. These oxidative reactions are performed by the
      activity of the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and CYP 2C8. Therefore, these
      enzymes participate in the oxidation of the alkyl side chain to hydroxyl and carboxyl
      derivatives. From this enzymes, the major catalyst in the formation of oxidative metabolites
      is the isoform CYP 2C9.[A39190]

      The metabolic phase I is followed by a phase II in which the oxidative metabolites may be
      conjugated to glucuronide prior to excretion. This activity forms phenolic and acyl
      glucuronides.[A39190]</metabolism>
    <absorption>It is very well absorbed orally and the peak serum concentration can be attained in
      1 to 2 hours after extravascular administration. When ibuprofen is administered immediately
      after a meal there is a slight reduction in the absorption rate but there is no change in the
      extent of the absorption.[A39092]

      When orally administered, the absorption of ibuprofen in adults is very rapidly done in the
      upper GI tract.[A39190] The average Cmax, Tmax and AUC ranges around 20 mcg/ml, 2 h and 70
      mcg.h/ml. These parameters can vary depending on the enantiomer form, route, and dose of
      administration.[A39190]</absorption>

    <name>Diphenhydramine</name>
    <metabolism>Diphenhydramine undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism [F3394, L5287,
      A174577]. In particular, two successive N-demethylations occur wherein diphenhydramine is
      demethylated to N-desmethyldiphenhydramine (the N-desmethyl metabolite) and then this
      metabolite is itself demethylated to N,N-didesmethyldiphenhydramine (the N,N-didesmethyl
      metabolite) [F3394, A174577]. Subsequently, acetyl metabolites like
      N-acetyl-N-desmethyldiphenhydramine are generated via the amine moiety of the N,N-didesmethyl
      metabolite [A174577]. Additionally, the N,N-didesmethyl metabolite also undergoes some
      oxidation to generate the diphenylmethoxyacetic acid metabolite as well [F3394, L5287,
      A174577]. The remaining percentage of a dose of administered diphenhydramine is excreted
      unchanged [F3394, L5287, A174577]. The metabolites are further conjugated with glycine and
      glutamine and excreted in urine [L5287].

      Moreover, studies have determined that a variety of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in
      the N-demethylation that characterizes the primary metabolic pathway of diphenhydramine,
      including CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 [A174574]. In particular, CYP2D6 demonstrates
      higher affinity catalysis with the diphenhydramine substrate than the other isoenzymes
      identified [A174574]. Consequently, inducers or inhibitors of these such CYP enzymes may
      potentially affect the serum concentration and incidence and/or severity of adverse effects
      associated with exposure to diphenhydramine [A174574].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Diphenhydramine is quickly absorbed after oral administration with maximum activity

      various beta-oxidation products, primarily by Cytochrome P450 3A4 in the intestine and
      liver.[F4670,F4673] Atorvastatin's metabolites undergo further lactonization via the formation

      hydrolyzed back to their corresponding acid forms and exist in equilibirum.[A19474,A181460]

      _In vitro_ inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is
      equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for
      HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites.[F4670,F4673]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Atorvastatin presents a dose-dependent and non-linear pharmacokinetic
      profile.[A177436] It is very rapidly absorbed after oral administration. After the
      administration of a dose of 40 mg, its peak plasma concentration of 28 ng/ml is reached 1-2
      hours after initial administration with an AUC of about 200 ng∙h/ml.[A177478] Atorvastatin
      undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the wall of the gut and the liver, resulting in
      an absolute oral bioavailability of 14%.[A177397] Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower
      (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with
      morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug
      administration.[F4670]

      Administration of atorvastatin with food results in prolonged Tmax and a reduction in Cmax and
      AUC.[A177415]

      Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important
      role in the absorption of atorvastatin.[A181460] Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of
      c.421C&gt;A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that
      individuals with the 421AA genotype have reduced functional activity and 1.72-fold higher AUC
      for atorvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has
      important implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and
      toxicity, particularly as the BCRP c.421C&gt;A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian
      populations than in Caucasians.[A181478, A181487] Other statin drugs impacted by this

    <name>Orlistat</name>
    <metabolism>Orlistat is hydrolyzed in the intestinal wall.[L31988] In a radiolabeled orlistat
      mass balance study in obese patients, two metabolites were identified. The first metabolite,
      M1, was the hydrolyzed β-lactone ring product of orlistat. The second metabolite, M3, was
      produced from M1’s cleavage of the N-formyl leucine side-chain. Both metabolites accounted for
      about 42% of total plasma radioactivity. Both M1 and M3 are considered pharmacologically

      concentrations of unchanged parent drug were close to the lower end of detection limits (&lt;5

      N-dealkylation to N-desisopropyl fluvastatin and beta-oxidation of the side chain also occurs.
      Metabolized primarily by the CYP2C9 isozyme system (75%), and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4
      (~20%) and CYP2C8 (~5%). Hydroxylated metabolites retain some pharmcological activity, but are
      present as conjugates (glucuronides and sulfates) in the blood and are rapidly eliminated via
      bile into feces. Both enantiomers of fluvastatin are metabolized in a similar manner.
      Fluvastatin also undergoes glucuronidation via UGT enzymes. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Rapidly and almost completely absorbed (&gt; 90%), but undergoes extensive first

      an immediate-release capsule administered under fasting conditions. When given orally,
      fluvastatin reaches peak concentrations (Tmax) in less than one hour. Taking the extended

    <name>Rosuvastatin</name>
    <metabolism>Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized, as demonstrated by the small amount of
      radiolabeled dose that is recovered as a metabolite (~10%). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 is
      primarily responsible for the formation of rosuvastatin's major metabolite,
      N-desmethylrosuvastatin, which has approximately 20-50% of the pharmacological activity of its
      parent compound in vitro.[F4649, F4652] However, this metabolic pathway isn't deemed to be
      clinically significant as there were no observable effects found on rosuvastatin
      pharmacokinetics when rosuvastatin was coadministered with fluconazole, a potent CYP2C9
      inhibitor.[A34483]

      In vitro and in vivo data indicate that rosuvastatin has no clinically significant cytochrome
      P450 interactions (as substrate, inhibitor or inducer). Consequently, there is little
      potential for drug-drug interactions upon coadministration with agents that are metabolized by
      cytochrome P450.[F4652]</metabolism>
    <absorption>In a study of healthy white male volunteers, the absolute oral bioavailability of
      rosuvastatin was found to be approximately 20% while absorption was estimated to be 50%, which
      is consistent with a substantial first-pass effect after oral dosing.[A181451, A181454]
      Another study in healthy volunteers found that the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of
      rosuvastatin was 6.06ng/mL and was reached at a median of 5 hours following oral
      dosing.[A181463] Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to dose. Neither food
      nor evening versus morning administration was shown to have an effect on the AUC of
      rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652] Many statins are known to interact with hepatic uptake
      transporters and thus reach high concentrations at their site of action in the liver.

      Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important
      role in the absorption of rosuvastatin, particularly as CYP3A4 has minimal involvement in its
      metabolism.[A181460] Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of c.421C&gt;A single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that individuals with the 421AA
      genotype have reduced functional activity and 2.4-fold higher AUC and Cmax values for
      rosuvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has important
      implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and toxicity,
      particularly as the BCRP c.421C&gt;A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian populations
      than in Caucasians.[A181478, A181487] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include
      [fluvastatin] and [atorvastatin].[A181478]

      Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1) hepatic
      transporter have also been shown to impact rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics. Evidence from
      pharmacogenetic studies of the c.521T&gt;C SNP showed that rosuvastatin AUC was increased
      1.62-fold for individuals homozygous for 521CC compared to homozygous 521TT
      individuals.[A181493] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [simvastatin],
      [pitavastatin], [atorvastatin], and [pravastatin].[A181460]

      For patients known to have the above-mentioned c.421AA BCRP or c.521CC OATP1B1 genotypes, a
      maximum daily dose of 20mg of rosuvastatin is recommended to avoid adverse effects from the
      increased exposure to the drug, such as muscle pain and risk of rhabdomyolysis.[F4652]</absorption>

      It undergoes N-demethylation to form N-desmethylsertraline, which is much less potent in its
      pharmacological activity than sertraline.[A187066] In addition to N-demethylation, sertraline
      metabolism involves N-hydroxylation, oxidative deamination, and finally,
      glucuronidation.[L9016] The metabolism of sertraline is mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6,
      with some activity accounted for by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.[A1846,L9022] </metabolism>
    <absorption>Following once-daily administration of 50 to 200 mg for two weeks, the mean peak
      plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours after
      administration, and measured at 20 to 55 μg/L.[A1846,L9016] Steady-state concentrations are
      reached after 1 week following once-daily administration, and vary greatly depending on the
      patient.[A187066,L9016] Bioavailability has been estimated to be above 44%. The area under the
      curve in healthy volunteers after a 100mg dose of sertraline was 456 μg × h/mL in one
      study.[A187066]

      **Effects of food on absorption**

      The effects of food on the bioavailability of the sertraline tablet and oral concentrate were
      studied in subjects given a single dose with and without food. For the tablet, AUC was
      slightly increased when sertraline was administered with food, the Cmax was 25% greater, and
      the time to peak plasma concentration was shortened by about 2.5 hours. For the oral
      concentrate preparation of sertraline, peak concentration was prolonged by approximately 1

    <absorption>Absorption of levofloxacin following oral administration is rapid and essentially

      interchangeable.[L11692] The T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is generally attained 1-2 hours
      following administration and the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to the given dose
      - an intravenous dose of 500mg infused over 60 minutes resulted in a

    <name>Bupropion</name>
    <metabolism>Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites are active:
      hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the tert-butyl group of bupropion, and
      the amino-alcohol isomers, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via
      reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal
      isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not
      involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Hydroxybupropion has been shown to have the
      same affinity as bupropion for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) but approximately 50% of
      its antidepressant activity despite reaching concentrations of ~10-fold higher than that of
      the parent drug.[A179062]

      Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of
      meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency
      and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized.
      However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that
      hydroxybupropion is one-half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and
      erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical
      importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high as or higher than
      those of bupropion.[FDA Label]

      Bupropion and its metabolites exhibit linear kinetics following chronic administration of 300
      to 450 mg per day.</metabolism>
    <absorption>Bupropion is currently available in 3 distinct, but bioequivalent formulations:
      immediate release (IR), sustained-release (SR), and extended-release (XL).

      **Immediate Release Formulation**
      In humans, following oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride tablets, peak plasma
      bupropion concentrations are usually achieved within 2 hours. IR formulations provide a short
      duration of action and are therefore generally dosed three times per day.

      **Sustained Release Formulation**
      In humans, following oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release tablets
      (SR), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of bupropion is usually achieved within 3 hours. SR
      formulations provide a 12-hour extended release of medication and are therefore generally
      dosed twice per day.

      **Extended Release Formulation**
      Following single oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL)
      to healthy volunteers, the median time to peak plasma concentrations for bupropion was
      approximately 5 hours. The presence of food did not affect the peak concentration or area
      under the curve of bupropion. XL formulations provide a 24-hour extended release of medication
      and are therefore generally dosed once per day/

      In a trial comparing chronic dosing with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR)
      150 mg twice daily to bupropion immediate-release formulation 100 mg 3 times daily, the steady
      state Cmax for bupropion after bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (SR)
      administration was approximately 85% of those achieved after bupropion immediate-release
      formulation administration. Exposure (AUC) to bupropion was equivalent for both formulations.
      Bioequivalence was also demonstrated for all three major active metabolites (i.e.,
      hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion) for both Cmax and AUC. Thus,
      at steady state, bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (SR) given twice daily, and
      the immediate-release formulation of bupropion given 3 times daily, are essentially
      bioequivalent for both bupropion and the 3 quantitatively important metabolites.[FDA Label]
      Furthermore, in a study comparing 14-day dosing with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release
      tablets (XL), 300 mg once-daily to the immediate-release formulation of bupropion at 100 mg 3
      times daily, equivalence was demonstrated for peak plasma concentration and area under the
      curve for bupropion and the three metabolites (hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and
      erythrohydrobupropion). Additionally, in a study comparing 14-day dosing with bupropion
      hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) 300 mg once daily to the sustained-release
      formulation of bupropion at 150 mg 2 times daily, equivalence was demonstrated for peak plasma
      concentration and area under the curve for bupropion and the three metabolites.[FDA Label]
      Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) can be taken with or without food.
      Bupropion Cmax and AUC were increased by 11% to 35% and 16% to 19%, respectively, when
      bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) was administered with food to healthy
      volunteers in three trials. The food effect is not considered clinically significant.[FDA
      Label]

      Following a single-dose administration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets
      (SR) in humans, Cmax of bupropion's metabolite hydroxybupropion occurs approximately 6 hours
      post-dose and is approximately 10 times the peak level of the parent drug at steady state. The
      elimination half-life of hydroxybupropion is approximately 20 (±5) hours and its AUC at steady
      state is about 17 times that of bupropion. The times to peak concentrations for the
      erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites are similar to that of the
      hydroxybupropion metabolite. However, their elimination half-lives are longer, 33(±10) and 37
      (±13) hours, respectively, and steady-state AUCs are 1.5 and 7 times that of bupropion,
      respectively.[FDA Label]</absorption>

    <name>Chloroprocaine</name>
    <metabolism>In plasma, chloroprocaine is quickly metabolized by pseudocholinesterases, a group
      of enzymes that perform the hydrolysis of the ester linkage. In ocular tissues, chloroprocaine
      is metabolized by nonspecific esterases.[L43387] The hydrolysis of chloroprocaine leads to the
      production of ß-diethylaminoethanol and 2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid, which inhibits the
      action of the sulfonamides.[L43377,L43382,L43387]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Thanks to its low risk for systemic toxicity, chloroprocaine has a rapid onset of
      action that usually ranges between 6 to 12 minutes.[L43377,L43382,L43402] The duration of
      chloroprocaine-induced anesthesia may be up to 60 minutes. The absorption rate of local
      anesthetics depends on the total dose and concentration of chloroprocaine, as well as the
      route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or
      absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic injection. The presence of epinephrine reduces the
      rate of absorption and plasma concentration of local anesthetics.[L43377,L43382] The systemic
      exposure to chloroprocaine following its topical ocular administration has not been
      evaluated.[L43387]</absorption>

    <name>Escitalopram</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, mediated primarily by CYP2C19 and
      CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2D6. Oxidative N-demethylation by the CYP enzyme system
      results in S-desmethylcitalopram (S-DCT) and S-didesmethylcitalopram (S-DDCT) - these
      metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of escitalopram, and exist in the
      plasma in small quantities relative to the parent compound (28-31% and &lt;5%,
      respectively).[L8513,L8516,L8522]

      There is also some evidence that escitalopram is metabolized to a propionic acid metabolite by
      monoamine oxidase A and B in the brain, and that these enzymes constitute the major route of
      escitalopram metabolism in the brain.[A39738]</metabolism>

      the blood to d-amphetamine, which is responsible for the drug’s therapeutic activity, as well
      as L-lysine. Amphetamine is reported to be oxidized at the 4 position of the benzene ring to
      form 4-hydroxyamphetamine, or on the side chain α or β carbons to form
      alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine or norephedrine, respectively. Norephedrine and
      4-hydroxy-amphetamine are both active and each is subsequently oxidized to form
      4-hydroxy-norephedrine. Alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine undergoes the process of deamination to form
      phenylacetone, which finally forms benzoic acid and its glucuronide and the glycine conjugate,
      _hippuric acid_. Although the enzymes involved in amphetamine metabolism have not been clearly

      acid hydrazone tricyclic dehydration product, and these metabolites can convert back and forth
      between these 2 forms.[A186301,A186316]

      Hydralazine can be converted to hydrazinophthalazinone, which is further converted to the
      active acetylhydrazinophthalazinone.[A186301,A186310]

      The final metabolic process hydralazine can undergo is the conversion to an unnamed
      hydralazine metabolite, which is further metabolized to 3-methyl-s-triazolophthalazine
      (MTP).[A186301] MTP can be metabolized to 9-hydroxy-methyltriazolophthalazine or
      3-hydroxy-methyltriazolophthalazine; the latter is converted to triazolophthalazine.[A186301]</metabolism>

    <name>Bismuth subsalicylate</name>
    <metabolism>Bismuth subsalicylate undergo hydrolysis at pH levels lesser than three. It is
      largely hydrolyzed in the stomach to bismuth oxychloride and salicylic acid. In the small
      intestine, unchanged bismuth subsalicylate reacts with other anions such as bicarbonate and
      phosphate to form insoluble bismuth salts. In the colon, unchanged bismuth subsalicylate and

      sulfide, a highly insoluble black salt responsible for the darkening of the stools.[A230733]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Following oral administration, bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes into bismuth and

      mibefradil undergoing first-pass metabolism is reduced, resulting in a steady state
      bioavailability of approximately 90%. Food does not affect the rate or extent of absorption of

    <metabolism>A large portion, 60-80%, of fenproporex is rapidly converted into amphetamine.
      Besides amphetamine, and unchanged fenproporex, 14 other metabolites were identified from
      urine samples.

      Two interacting metabolic pathways are believed to exist. The major pathway is believed to
      involve ring-degradation by aromatic hydroxylation, methylation, and side chain degradation by
      N-dealkyation to form amphetamine. The minor pathway involves the beta-hydroxylation of
      amphetamine to form norephedrine. [6]

      dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide. [1]

      The time for mean peak concentration in acid metabolites is 1.76h and 1.98h for a 30 and 60mg

      The AUCs after oral and intravenous administration are similar (3203ug/l/h and 3401ug/l/h,

  <drug type="small molecule" created="2007-08-29" updated="2023-01-03">
    <name>Zinc</name>
    <metabolism>Zinc is released from food as free ions during its digestion. These freed ions may
      then combine with endogenously secreted ligands before their transport into the enterocytes in
      the duodenum and jejunum. [L2092]. Selected transport proteins may facilitate the passage of
      zinc across the cell membrane into the hepatic circulation. With high intake, zinc may also be
      absorbed through a passive paracellular route [L2092].

      The portal system carries absorbed zinc directly into the hepatic circulation, and then it is
      released into systemic circulation for delivery to various tissues. Although, serum zinc
      represents only 0.1% of the whole body zinc, the circulating zinc turns over rapidly to meet
      tissue needs [L2092].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine by a carrier-mediated mechanism [L2092].
      Under regular physiologic conditions, transport processes of uptake do not saturate. The exact
      amount of zinc absorbed is difficult to determine because zinc is secreted into the gut. Zinc
      administered in aqueous solutions to fasting subjects is absorbed quite efficiently (at a rate
      of 60-70%), however, absorption from solid diets is less efficient and varies greatly,
      dependent on zinc content and diet composition [L2092].

      Generally, 33% is considered to be the average zinc absorption in humans [L2092]. More recent
      studies have determined different absorption rates for various populations based on their type
      of diet and phytate to zinc molar ratio. Zinc absorption is concentration dependent and
      increases linearly with dietary zinc up to a maximum rate [L2092].

      Additionally zinc status may influence zinc absorption. Zinc-deprived humans absorb this
      element with increased efficiency, whereas humans on a high-zinc diet show a reduced
      efficiency of absorption [L2092].</absorption>

      information regarding the remaining minor metabolites has not been elucidated.</metabolism>
    <absorption>When administered alone, lopinavir has exceptionally low oral bioavailability (~25%)
      - for this reason, it is exclusively co-administered with ritonavir, which dramatically
      improves bioavailability, hinders drug metabolism, and allows for the attainment of
      therapeutic lopinavir concentrations.[A191715,A191748] Following oral administration of
      lopinavir/ritonavir, maximal plasma concentrations are achieved at approximately 4.4 hours
      (T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), and the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and

    <metabolism>Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens.
      Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These
      transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone,
      and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also
      undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver,
      biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by
      reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens
      exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating
      reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.</metabolism>

    <name>Metamizole</name>
    <metabolism>Metamizole undergoes rapid hydrolysis to the active moiety 4-methyl-amino-antipyrine
      (MAA). MAA is then metabolized to 4-formyl-amino-antipyrine (FAA) via c-oxidation and
      4-amino-antipyrine (AA) via N-demethylation. The N-demethylation of MAA is mainly mediated by
      CYP3A4, although CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 may also be involved.[A251885] FAA is an end
      metabolite, while AA is acetylated by N-acetyl-transferase to form 4-acetyl-amino-antipyrine
      (AAA).[A251890] The unchanged drug may be present in plasma following the intravenous
      administration of metamizole; however, following oral administration, it cannot be detected in
      plasma or urine.[A251890]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Metamizole is hydrolyzed to 4-methyl-amino-antipyrine (MAA) in gastric juice and is
      mostly absorbed in this form. MAA bioavailability differs based on the administration route.
      In patients given metamizole tablets, the bioavailability of MAA is 85%, in patients given
      drops, 89%, in patients given suppositories, 54%, and in patients given an intramuscular
      injection, 87%.[A251890] There is a linear relationship between metamizole oral dose and MAA

    <name>Tetrabenazine</name>
    <metabolism>Tetrabenazine is hepatically metabolized. Carbonyl reductase in the liver is
      responsible for the formation of two major active metabolites: α-dihydrotetrabenazine (α-HTBZ)
      and β-dihydrotetrabenazine (β-HTBZ). α-HTBZ is further metabolized into 9-desmethyl-α-DHTBZ, a
      minor metabolite by CYP2D6 and with some contribution of CYP1A2. β-HTBZ is metabolized to
      another major circulating metabolite, 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ, by CYP2D6. The Tmax of this
      metabolite is 2 hours post-administration of tetrabenazine. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Following oral administration of tetrabenazine, the extent of absorption is at least
      75%. After single oral doses ranging from 12.5 to 50 mg, plasma concentrations of
      tetrabenazine are generally below the limit of detection because of the rapid and extensive
      hepatic metabolism of tetrabenazine. Food does not affect the absorption of tetrabenazine.

      dose and 74% for 400 mg dose) from the gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability of
      celiprolol has been shown to be markedly affected by food and one should avoid administration
      of celiprolol with food. Coadministration of chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide and
      theophylline also reduces the bioavailability of celiprolol. Following oral dosing, maximal
      blood concentrations are reached between 2 and 3 hours.</absorption>

    <name>Roxadustat</name>
    <metabolism>_In vitro_, roxadustat is a substrate for CYP2C8 and UGT1A9 enzymes. Roxadustat is
      primarily metabolized to hydroxy-roxadustat and roxadustat O-glucuronide. Unchanged roxadustat
      was the major circulating component in human plasma and detectable metabolites in human plasma
      constituted less than 10% of total drug-related material exposure. No human-specific
      metabolites were observed [L40318] but roxadustat O-glucuronide was detected in human urine
      sample.[A245403]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Roxadustat plasma exposure (AUC and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) increases
      dose-proportionally within the recommended therapeutic dose range. In a three times per week
      dosing regimen, steady-state roxadustat plasma concentrations are achieved within one week
      (three doses) with minimal accumulation. Maximum plasma concentrations
      (C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) are usually achieved at two hours post dose in the fasted state.
      Administration of roxadustat with food decreased C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; by 25% but did
      not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state.[L40318]</absorption>

    <name>Febuxostat</name>
    <metabolism>Febuxostat is metabolized in the liver by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and
      Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, with the relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the
      metabolism of febuxostat not fully elucidated. UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 mediate
      conjugation of febuxostat,[L32238] which approximately accounts for 22–44% of the metabolism
      of the total dose administered, to produce the acyl-glucuronide metabolite.[A230548] CYP1A2,
      CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and non-P450 enzymes are responsible for the oxidation reaction, which
      accounts for 2-8% of the metabolism of the dose.[A230548] Oxidation reaction produces 67M-1,
      67M-2, and 67M-4, which are pharmacologically active metabolites. 67M-1, 67M-2, and 67M-4 can
      further undergo glucuronidation and sulfation.[A230598] Hydroxy metabolites are present in
      human plasma at much lower concentrations than the parent drug.[L32238]</metabolism>
    <absorption>After oral administration, about 85% of febuxostat is absorbed rapidly.[A230548]
      T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; ranges from 1 to 1.5 hours. Following once-daily oral
      administration, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was approximately 1.6 ± 0.6 mcg/mL at a dose of 40
      mg febuxostat and 2.6 ± 1.7 mcg/mL at a dose of 80 mg febuxostat.[L32238]

      A high-fat meal decreased C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; by 49% and AUC by 18%, but there were no

    <name>Dronedarone</name>
    <metabolism>Dronedarone predominantly undergoes CYP3A-mediated hepatic metabolism. Initial
      metabolism of dronedarone involves N-debutylation to form the N-debutyl-dronedarone, which
      retains 1/10 to 1/3 of pharmacological activity of the parent compound.[L8699]
      N-debutyl-dronedarone can be further metabolized to phenol-dronedarone via O-dealkylation and
      propanoic acid-dronedarone via oxidative deamination. Dronedarone can also be metabolized by
      CYP2D6 to form benzofuran-hydroxyl-dronedarone. Other detectable metabolites include
      C-dealkyl-dronedarone and dibutylamine-hydroxyl-dronedarone, along with other minor downstream
      metabolites with undetermined chemical structures.[A186110]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Dronedarone is well absorbed after oral administration (&gt;70%).[A34604] It
      displays low systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The absolute
      bioavailability of dronedarone without and with a high-fat meal is 4% and 15%, respectively.
      The peak plasma concentrations of dronedarone and its main circulating N-debutyl metabolite
      are reached within 3 to 6 hours after administration with food.

      Following repeated administration of 400 mg dronedarone twice daily, the steady-state was
      reached within 4 to 8 days of initial treatment. The steady-state Cmax and systemic exposure
      to the N-debutyl metabolite are similar to that of the parent compound.[L8699]</absorption>

    <name>Milnacipran</name>
    <metabolism>It has been determined that levomilnacipran undergoes desethylation and
      hydroxylation to generate desethyl levomilnacipran and p-hydroxy-levomilnacipran, respectively
      [F3919, F3922, A175897]. Both oxidative metabolites undergo further conjugation with
      glucuronide to form the conjugate milnacipran carbamoyl-O-glucuronide [F3919, F3922, F3925,
      A175897]. The desethylation is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 with minor contribution by
      CYP2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 2J2 [F3919, F3922]. Additionally, it is the general understanding that
      there is no interconversion between the enantiomers of milnacipran in the body [F3919, F3922,
      F3925, F3928].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Racemic milnacipram demonstrates an absolute bioavailability of about 85-90%
      following oral administration [F3925]. Maximum concentrations of the racemic agent are reached
      within 2-4 hours after oral dosing, and steady-state levels are obtained by 36-48 hours
      [F3925].

      Conversely, the relative bioavailability of levomilnacipram has been documented as 92% [F3919,
      F3922]. The median time to peak concentration Tmax for levomilnacipram is about 6-8 hours
      after oral administration [F3919, F3922]. After daily dosing of levomilnacipram 120 mg, the
      mean Cmax value is 341 ng/mL, and the mean steady-state AUC value is 5196 ng.h/mL.

      In general, the administration of either racemic milnacipram or levomilnacipram with food does
      not affect the medication's oral bioavailability [F3925, F3919, F3922]. </absorption>

    <metabolism>Lofexidine metabolic ratio is highly variable among people.[T210] It is metabolized

      N-(2-aminoethyl)-2-(2,6-dichlorophenoxy)propanamide. This metabolite is deamidated and forms

    <name>Migalastat</name>
    <metabolism>Based upon in vivo data, migalastat is a substrate for uridine diphosphate
      glucuronosyltransferase (otherwise known as UGT or UDPGT), being a minor elimination pathway
      [FDA Label, F1107]. Migalastat is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gP) in vitro and it is
      considered unlikely that migalastat would be subject to drug-drug interactions with cytochrome
      P450s [FDA Label, F1107]. A pharmacokinetic trial in healthy male volunteers with 150 mg
      [14C]-migalastat HCl revealed that 99% of the radiolabeled dose recovered in plasma was
      comprised of unchanged migalastat (77%) and 3 dehydrogenated O-glucuronide conjugated
      metabolites, M1, M2, and M3 (13%) [FDA Label, F1107]. Approximately 9% of the total
      radioactivity was unassigned [FDA Label, F1107].</metabolism>
    <absorption>With absorption occurring largely in the gut [L4263], the absolute bioavailability
      (AUC) for a single oral 150 mg migalastat hydrochloride dose or a single 2-hour 150 mg
      intravenous infusion was approximately 75% [FDA Label, F1107]. Following a single oral dose of
      150 mg migalastat hydrochloride solution, the time to peak plasma concentration was
      approximately 3 hours [FDA Label, F1107]. Plasma migalastat exposure (AUC0-∞) and Cmax
      demonstrated dose-proportional increases at migalastat hydrochloride oral doses from 50 mg to
      1,250 mg [FDA Label, F1107].

      Migalastat administered with a high-fat meal, or 1 hour before a high-fat or light meal, or 1
      hour after a light meal, resulted in significant reductions of 37% to 42% in mean total
      migalastat exposure (AUC0-∞) and reductions of 15% to 40% in mean peak migalastat exposure
      (Cmax) compared with the fasting state [FDA Label, F1107].</absorption>

    <name>Indacaterol</name>
    <metabolism>After oral administration of radiolabeled indacaterol, unchanged indacaterol was the
      main component in serum, accounting for about one third of total drug-related AUC over 24
      hours. The monohydroxylated derivative, glucuronide conjugate, and the 8-O-glucuronide were
      the most prominent metabolites in serum. Other metabolites identified include a diastereomer
      of the hydroxylated derivative, a N-glucuronide of indacaterol, and C- and N-dealkylated
      products.

      In vitro investigations indicated that UGT1A1 was the only UGT isoform that metabolized
      indacaterol to the phenolic O-glucuronide. CYP3A4 is the predominant isoenzyme responsible for
      hydroxylation of indacaterol.</metabolism>
    <absorption>The median time to reach peak serum concentrations of indacaterol was approximately

    <metabolism>No _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ studies of levoketoconazole metabolism have been
      performed. [Ketoconazole] is known to be hepatically metabolized to several inactive
      metabolites, mainly through oxidation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, together with
      oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation.[L39563] Levoketoconazole is known to both
      induce and strongly inhibit CYP3A4.[A23103, A244088, L39563]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Levoketoconazole has a T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of ~1.5-2 hours regardless of
      dose, while the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; increases proportionally with the dose. The AUC
      increases greater than dose proportionally over the recommended range of 150-600 mg.
      Co-administration of a single 600 mg oral dose with a high-fat meal increased the AUC by 30%
      with no change in C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and a delay in the median
      T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; from two to four hours. The pharmacokinetics of racemic
      [ketoconazole] are not significantly different in patients with renal impairment; given the
      extensive hepatic metabolism of [ketoconazole], it is expected that hepatic impairment will
      affect the pharmacokinetics of levoketoconazole.[L39563]</absorption>

    <name>Apremilast</name>
    <metabolism>Apremilast is heavily metabolized by various pathways, which include oxidation,
      hydrolysis, in addition to conjugation. About 23 metabolites are produced from its
      metabolism.[A3737] The CYP3A4 primarily mediates the oxidative metabolism of this drug, with
      smaller contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 enzymes.[L7498] The main metabolite of
      apremilast, M12, is an inactive glucuronide conjugate form of the O-demethylated drug.[L7498]
      Some other major metabolites, M14 and M16, are significantly less active in the inhibition of
      PDE4 and inflammatory mediators than their parent drug, apremilast. After an oral dose,
      unchanged apremilast (45%) and the inactive metabolite, O-desmethyl apremilast glucuronide
      (39%) are found in the plasma. [A181235] Minor metabolites M7 and M17 are active, but are only
      present in about 2% or less of apremilast concentrations, and likely not significant
      contributors to the actions of apremilast.[A181235]</metabolism>
    <absorption>An oral dose of apremilast is well-absorbed and the absolute bioavailability is
      approximately 73%. Tmax is approximately 2.5 hours[L7501] and Cmax has been reported to be
      approximately 584 ng/mL in one pharmacokinetic study.[A181229] Food intake does not appear to
      affect apremilast absorption.[L7501]</absorption>

    <name>Obeticholic acid</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of obeticholic acid occurs in the liver. Obeticholic acid is
      conjugated with glycine or taurine, followed by secretion into bile. The conjugates are then
      absorbed in the small intestine and then re-enter the liver via enterohepatic circulation. The
      intestinal microbiota in the ileum converts conjugated obeticholic acid in a deconjugated form
      that may be either reabsorbed or eliminated. Glycine conjugates account for 13.8% of the
      metabolites and taurine conjugates account for 12.3%. Another metabolite, 3-glucuronide, may
      also be formed, but displays little pharmacological activity.[L12633]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Obeticholic acid is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The Cmax of obeticholic

      the active site of reductases. CT4889 and CT-45890 are also formed.[3] </metabolism>
    <absorption>Intravenous administration results in a rapid distribution followed by a slow

      uptake than in DOX-loaded myocardial strips. DOX clearance causes membrane effects which may
      be responsible for this observation. DOX clearance involves rapid passive diffusion through
      one side of the membrane followed by "flip flop" reorientation of the lipid bilayer. This
      disorganization of lipids is believed to impair membrane penetration by pixantrone. [3] </absorption>

    <name>Silodosin</name>
    <metabolism>The main metabolite of silodosin is silodosin glucuronide (KMD-3213G), which is a
      pharmacologically active metabolite formed by direct glucuronide conjugation mediated by
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7). Silodosin glucuronide reaches plasma exposure (AUC)
      approximately four times greater than that of silodosin. The second major metabolite,
      KMD-3293, is formed from dehydrogenation catalyzed by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases.
      KMD-3293 has negligible pharmacological activity and reaches plasma exposures similar to that
      of silodosin. Silodosin is also metabolized by CYP3A4, which catalyzes the oxidation
      reaction.[L32368]

      Other than glucuronidation, dehydrogenation, and oxidation as its main metabolic pathways,
      silodosin can also undergo dealkylation (KMD-3289), N-dealkylation, hydroxylation,
      glucosylation, and sulfate conjugation. Metabolites of silodosin can undergo a series of
      further metabolic pathways.[A231179]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The absolute bioavailability is approximately 32%. Following oral administration of
      silodosin 8 mg once daily in healthy male subjects, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 61.6 ±

      cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent by
      CYP2C9 and CYP2C19). The active metabolite is further metabolized by S-methylation or cysteine
      conjugation to two inactive metabolites.

      Unlike clopidogrel, transformation of prasugrel to its active metabolite does not appear to be

    <name>Ferumoxytol</name>
    <metabolism>Ferumoxytol metabolism is not dependent on renal function. It is removed from the
      circulation by the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [L2186].
      Iron, bound to transferrin, is then transported in the plasma and distributed to the bone
      marrow for the synthesis of hemoglobin, to the reticuloendothelial system for storage, and to
      all cells for enzymes containing iron, and to placental cells if needed to meet fetal needs.
      Transferrin eventually becomes available for recycling. In normal adults, 90% of metabolized
      iron is conserved and reutilized repeatedly [L2190].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Bioavailability studies were not conducted as ferumoxytol has been developed for IV
      administration only [L2179].

      Iron therapy dosage is individualized according to specific goals for blood iron
      concentrations, iron storage parameters (e.g., ferritin, transferrin saturation), and serum
      hemoglobin concentrations. Iron toxicity is possible with excessive or unnecessary iron
      therapy. Systemic iron is stored in ferritin and hemosiderin, which are utilized for future
      production of hemoglobin. The absorption of iron depends on the route of administration. The
      tissue that first clears parenterally ingested iron from the plasma determines its
      bioavailability. If the reticuloendothelial system clears iron effectively, only small amounts
      will become available over time to the bone marrow. Transferrin accepts iron from the
      intestinal tract and also from sites of hemoglobin storage and destruction [L2190].</absorption>

    <name>Amrubicin</name>
    <metabolism>The primary metabolite (amrubicinol) in rats and dogs is a product of reduction by
      cytoplasmic carbonyl reductase at the C-13 carbonyl group. Other enzymes participating in the
      metabolism of amrubicin and amrubicinol were nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,
      reduced form (NADPH)–P450 reductase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [phosphate]
      (NAD[P]H)-quinone oxidoreductase. Twelve additional metabolites were detected in vivo and in
      vitro in one study [L1710].

      Peak plasma concentrations of the active metabolite amrubicinol were observed from immediately
      after dosing to 1 hour after dosing [L1710].

      These included four aglycone metabolites, two amrubicinol glucuronides, deaminated amrubicin,
      and five highly polar unknown metabolites. In vitro cell growth inhibitory activity of the
      minor metabolites was substantially lower than that of amrubicinol. Excretion of amrubicin and
      its metabolites is primarily hepatobiliary. Enterohepatic recycling was demonstrated in rats.</metabolism>
    <absorption>Peak plasma concentrations of the active metabolite _amrubicinol_ were observed from
      immediately after administration of amrubicin to 1h after administration. Plasma
      concentrations of amrubicinol were low compared with amrubicin plasma concentrations. The
      plasma amrubicinol AUC (area under the curve) was approximately 10-fold lower than the
      amrubicin plasma AUC. Concentrations of amrubicinol were higher in RBCs as compared with
      plasma. Amrubicinol AUCs ranged from 2.5-fold to 57.9-fold higher in red blood cells (RBCs)
      compared to plasma. Because amrubicinol distributes itself into RBCs more than amrubicin, the
      concentrations of amrubicinol and amrubicin in RBCs were quite similar. The AUC of amrubicinol
      in RBCs was approximately twofold lower than the amrubicin RBC AUC [L1713].

      In one study, after repeated daily amrubicin administration, amrubicinol accumulation was
      observed in plasma and RBCs. On day 3, the amrubicinol plasma AUC was 1.2-fold to 6-fold
      higher than day 1 values; the RBC AUC was 1.2-fold to 1.7-fold higher than day 1 values. After
      5 consecutive daily doses, plasma and RBC amrubicinol AUCs were 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold higher
      than day 1 values [L1713].</absorption>

      is subsequently metabolized to the active form.[A236225, L34675, L34680] _In vitro_ studies
      and observations regarding the oral bioavailability and levels of plasma prodrug suggest
      extensive first-pass metabolism by carboxylesterases, first by intestinal CES2 to form
      BIBR0951 (also known as M2) and then subsequently by hepatic CES1 to form [dabigatran].
      Dabigatran etexilate can also first undergo CES1-mediated hydrolysis to BIBR1087 (M1) followed
      by CES2-mediated hydrolysis to [dabigatran], though it is hypothesized that the former pathway
      accounts for most of the active form in plasma.[A17923, A236195] Dabigatran can undergo
      1-_O_-acyl glucuronidation by UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 followed by acyl migration to form
      the corresponding 2-_O_-, 3-_O_-, and 4-_O_-acyl glucuronides; all of these acyl glucuronides
      exhibit activity similar to [dabigatran] but account for a small fraction of recovered
      metabolites.[A236225, A17924, L34675, L34680]

      In addition to these better characterized metabolic pathways, detailed LC/MS characterization
      suggests a wide variety of possible metabolites following oral or intravenous administration,
      most of which are present in only trace amounts in plasma, urine, or feces. These include a
      variety of oxidation, hydrolysis, and conjugation products, including through the addition of
      mannitol.[A236225]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Oral dabigatran has a bioavailability of 3-7%, although the relative bioavailability
      of dabigatran pellets is 37% higher than that for capsules and the bioavailability increases
      to 75% when the capsule shell is removed; dabigatran capsules should not be tampered with in
      any way prior to administration. The C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is achieved by one hour
      following oral dosing, which is extended to two hours if accompanied by a high-fat meal.
      Dabigatran can be taken with or without food. Dabigatran pharmacokinetics are approximately

    <name>Capsaicin</name>
    <metabolism>Capsaicin metabolism after oral administration is unclear, however it is expected to
      undergo metabolism in the liver with minimal metabolism in the gut lumen. _In vitro_ studies
      with human hepatic microsomes and S9 fragments indicate that capsaicin is rapidly metabolized,
      producing three major metabolites, 16-hydroxycapsaicin, 17-hydroxycapsaicin, and
      16,17-hydroxycapsaicin, whereas vanillin was a minor metabolite [A32319]. It is proposed that
      cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes may play some role in hepatic drug metabolism [A32319]. _In
      vitro_ studies of capsaicin in human skin suggest slow biotransformation with most capsaicin
      remaining unchanged.</metabolism>
    <absorption>**Oral**: Following oral administration, capsaicin may be absorbed by a nonactive
      process from the stomach and whole intestine with an extent of absorption ranging between 50
      and 90%, depending on the animal [A32319]. The peak blood concentration can be reached within
      1 hour following administration [A32319]. Capsaicin may undergo minor metabolism in the small
      intestine epithelial cells post-absorption from the stomach into the small intestines. While
      oral pharmacokinetics information in humans is limited, ingestion of equipotent dose of 26.6
      mg of pure capsaicin, capsaicin was detected in the plasma after 10 minutes and the peak
      plasma concentration of 2.47 ± 0.13 ng/ml was reached at 47.1 ± 2.0 minutes [A32319].
      **Systemic**: Following intravenous or subcutaneous administration in animals, the
      concentrations in the brain and spinal cord were approximately 5-fold higher than that in
      blood and the concentration in the liver was approximately 3-fold higher than that in blood
      [A32319].

      **Topical**: Topical capsaicin in humans is rapidly and well absorbed through the skin,
      however systemic absorption following topical or transdermal administration is unlikely
      [A32319]. For patients receiving the topical patch containing 179 mg of capsaicin, a

      one-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination. The mean peak plasma

    <name>Pitavastatin</name>
    <metabolism>The principal route of pitavastatin metabolism is glucuronidation via liver uridine
      5'-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) with subsequent formation of pitavastatin
      lactone. There is only minimal metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system. Pitavastatin is
      marginally metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8. The major metabolite in
      human plasma is the lactone, which is formed via an ester-type pitavastatin glucuronide
      conjugate by UGTs (UGT1A3 and UGT2B7).[F4667,A182015]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Pitavastatin peak plasma concentrations are achieved about 1 hour after oral
      administration. Both Cmax and AUC0-inf increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner
      for single pitavastatin doses from 1 mg to 24 mg once daily. The absolute bioavailability of
      pitavastatin oral solution is 51%. The Cmax and AUC of pitavastatin did not differ following
      evening or morning drug administration. In healthy volunteers receiving 4 mg pitavastatin, the
      percent change from baseline for LDL-C following evening dosing was slightly greater than that
      following morning dosing. Pitavastatin was absorbed in the small intestine but very little in
      the colon.[F4667]

      Compared to other statins, pitavastatin has a relatively high bioavailability, which has been
      suggested to occur due to enterohepatic reabsorption in the intestine following intestinal
      absorption.[A182015]

      transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family
      member 1B1) have been shown to impact pitavastatin pharmacokinetics. Evidence from
      pharmacogenetic studies of the c.521T&gt;C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene
      encoding OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) demonstrated that pitavastatin AUC was increased 3.08-fold for
      individuals homozygous for 521CC compared to homozygous 521TT individuals.[A40073] Other
      statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [simvastatin], [pitavastatin],

    <name>Eliglustat</name>
    <metabolism>Eliglustat is mostly metabolized by CYP2D6, and to a lower extent, by
      CYP3A4.[L41404] In patients that are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), eliglustat is mainly
      metabolized by CYP3A4. The primary metabolic pathways of eliglustat involve the sequential
      oxidation of the octanoyl moiety and the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxane moiety. The combination
      of these two pathways results in the production of several oxidative metabolites.[L41414]

      After evaluating the potency of eliglustat metabolites, it was determined that none of them
      were active.[L41414] Genz-399240 (M24) was identified as the major metabolite of eliglustat,
      while the rest of the metabolites contributed to less than 10% of total drug-related
      exposures.[L41409] Genz-399240 (M24) did not show any major off-target effects; therefore, a
      transporter substrate specificity characterization was not performed.[L41409] </metabolism>
    <absorption>Eliglustat administered in multiple doses of 84 mg twice daily had a
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 12.1 to 25.0 ng/mL in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs), 44.6
      ng/mL in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and 113 to 137 ng/mL in CYP2D6 poor
      metabolizers (PMs).[L41404] The median T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was 1.5-2 hr in CYP2D6 EMs,

      76.3-143 ng∙hr/mL in CYP2D6 EMs, 306 ng∙hr/mL in CYP2D6 IMs, and 922-1057 ng∙hr/mL in CYP2D6
      PMs.[L41404] In CYP2D6 EMs, the pharmacokinetics of eliglustat is time-dependent, and for
      doses that range between 42 and 294 mg, exposure increases in a more than dose-proportional
      fashion. In CYP2D6 PMs, eliglustat pharmacokinetics is linear and time-independent. In a
      steady state, the systemic exposure of 84 mg eliglustat twice daily is 7- to 9-fold higher in
      CYP2D6 PMs compared to EMs.[L41404]

      Following the oral administration of a single 84 mg dose of eliglustat, bioavailability in
      CYP2D6 EMs was lower than 5%.[L41404] The low oral bioavailability of eliglustat suggests the
      role of transporters and/or an extensive first-pass metabolism.[L41409] Eliglustat can be
      taken with or without food.[L41404] In CYP2D6 EMs, severe renal impairment did not have an
      effect on eliglustat pharmacokinetics. The effect of renal impairment on eliglustat
      pharmacokinetics was not evaluated in CYP2D6 IMs, CYP2D6 PMs or CYP2D6 EMs with end-stage
      renal failure.[L41404] Compared to CYP2D6 EMs with normal hepatic function,
      C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and AUC were 1.2-fold higher in CYP2D6 EMs with mild hepatic
      impairment, while C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and AUC were 2.8- and 5.2-fold higher,
      respectively, in CYP2D6 EMs with moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of mild and moderate
      hepatic impairment in CYP2D6 IMs and PMs, and the effect of severe hepatic impairment were not
      evaluated.[L41404]

    <absorption>After oral administration, pinaverium is poorly absorbed (5-10%) followed by uptake
      by liver. Poor absorption is due to its highly polar quaternary ammonium group and high
      molecular weight [L873], which limits extensive diffusion across all cell membranes and
      promotes its selectivity towards the gastrointestinal tracts []. Peak plasma concentration is
      reached within one hour after administration and the absolute oral bioavailability is reported

    <name>Tixocortol</name>
    <metabolism>Tixocortol is rapidly modified within red blood cells and it is immediately
      metabolized by a first-pass liver metabolism.[L1078] The metabolites of tixocortol are mainly
      represented by the formation of sulfo- and glucurono-conjugates which are later hydrolyzed
      from the conjugate forming neutral steroids. The metabolic transformations are the reduction
      of the 3-keto and delta 4 system, reduction of the C-20 carbonyl group, oxidation of the C-11
      alcohol and cleavage of the side chain at C-17. The specific metabolic pathways of the C-21
      thiol ester function were its transformation into methylthio, methylsulfonyl and
      methylsulfonyl derivatives and reductive cleavage of the C-21-S bond leading to 21-methyl
      structures. None of the metabolites have affinity for glucocorticoid receptors. This and the
      extensive metabolism explains the exclusive local activities of tixocortol.[A31443]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The absorption of tixocortol is the same as in other steroids including
      hydrocortisone.[L1078] Oral administration of tixocortol presents a 10-20% bioavailability
      with a significantly lower plasma Cmax than cortisol. The fast metabolism, larger volume of
      distribution and low bioavailability donates tixocortol with the absence of systemic
      activity.[A31439] </absorption>

      rectal administration of diflucortolone produces a slow and low absorption with an AUC, Cmax

    <name>Protamine sulfate</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolic fate of the inactive heparin-protamine complex has not yet been
      formally elucidated [F3559, F3562, L5371, L5443]. Nevertheless, considering protamine sulfate
      is itself objectively a mixture of basic protein peptide sulfates prepared from sperm or roe
      of appropriate species of fish (typically of the families Clupeidae or Salmonidae), the
      involvement of basic protein catalysis via the participation of endogenous peptidases may
      presumably play a part in the metabolism of protamine sulfate [F3562]. Moreover, as protamine
      sulfate specifically reverses the anticoagulant activities of heparin by complexing with it,
      it has also been proposed that the heparin-protamine complex may be plausibly metabolized in
      part by the lytic enzyme fibrinolysin - a process which would also free heparin [F3559, L5371,
      L5443].</metabolism>
    <absorption>In general, based on data obtained from protamine sulfate administered in healthy
      humans the AUC demonstrated during the initial infusion is concave [F3562]. Protamine
      concentrations were less than the limit of detection after twenty minutes or less, although
      the onset of action had been reported to appear within thirty to sixty seconds after
      intravenous administration [F3559, F3562, L5371, L5443] It is, however, generally documented
      that the neutralization of heparin occurs within five minutes after the intravenous
      administration of protamine sulfate [F3559, L5371, L5443].

      Moreover, protamine concentration-versus-time data appears to be substantially different
      between men and women, where weight-adjusted protamine sulfate dosing ended up in
      significantly decreased AUC and substantially greater plasma clearance and volume of
      distribution at steady state in women as compared to men [F3562].</absorption>

      CYP3A5.[A31959]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Benidipine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration reaching a maximum
      concentration within 2 hours. The short period of time needed for maximum concentration to get
      reached is a particular characteristic of benidipine when compared with other calcium channel
      blockers. The registered maximum concentration and AUC are dose-dependent and it can go from
      0.55-3.89 ng/ml and 1.04-6.7 ng.h/ml respectively when administered in a dose of 2-8

    <name>Cilnidipine</name>
    <metabolism>Cilnidipine is metabolized by both liver and kidney. It is rapidly metabolized by
      liver microsomes by a dehydrogenation process. The major enzymatic isoform involved in
      cilnidipine dehydrogenation of the dihydropyridine ring is CYP3A.[L1440]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Cilnidipine presents a very rapid absorption with a maximum peaked concentration
      after 2 hours. Its distribution tends to be higher in the liver as well as in kidneys, plasma
      and other tissues. Cilnidipine does not present a high accumulation in the tissue after
      repeated oral administration.[L1444]

      Cilnidipine is reported to present very low bioavailability determined to be approximately
      13%. This low bioavailability is suggested to be due to its low aqueous solubility and high
      permeability. Hence, efforts have been made in order to find an innovative formulation that
      can significantly improve the bioavailability of this drug. One of these formulations
      corresponds to the generation of polymeric nanoparticles which enhance the bioavailability by
      2.5-3-fold.[L6124]</absorption>

    <name>Efonidipine</name>
    <metabolism>It has been suggested that efonidipine is less likely to be subject to the
      first-pass than other members of its drug class, and and that its dihydropyridine ring is
      oxidized primarily after metabolism of the side chain [L1443]. Efonidipine is highly
      lipophilic and this allows for its entry into the phospholipid-rich cell membrane and reach
      the dihydropyridine binding site of the calcium channel targets [L1446].

      Efonidipine is mainly metabolized in the liver. Its metabolites are N-dephenylated Efonidipine
      (DPH), deaminated efonidipine (AL) and N-debenzylated Efonidipine (DBZ). Both metabolites
      behave as calcium antagonists. In one study, the vasodilating capabilities of DBZ and DPH were
      about two-thirds and one-third respectively than that of the unmetabolized drug. Research
      suggests that the majority of the pharmacological effect after oral dosing of efonidipine
      hydrochloride is due to unchanged drug and its metabolites play little role in its therapeutic
      effect.

      In a study of six healthy volunteers, no significant amount of unchanged drug was excreted in
      urine. The urine samples collected for 24 h after oral efonidipine administration, 1.1% of the
      dose was excreted as deaminated-efonidipine, and 0.5% as a pyridine analogue of
      deaminated-efonidipine [L1457].</metabolism>
    <absorption>The metabolism of efonidipine was studied in rats. The absorption ratio of
      radioactivity estimated from the sum of biliary and urinary excretions was found to be
      approximately 62% [L1457]. The radioactivity was high in the gastrointestinal tract and liver,
      followed by the adrenal glands [L1457], suggesting high rates of metabolism in these regions.
      The unchanged drug in the plasma accounted for 47.7% of radioactivity at 2hr after ingestion,
      demonstrating a lower first-pass effect in comparison with other drugs in the same class. In
      plasma, major metabolites of NZ-105 were: N-debenzylated compound (DBZ), N-dephenylated
      compound (DPH), oxidative deaminated compound (AL), AL-corresponding pyridine compound (ALP),
      unknown metabolite M-1 and M-25. NZ-105 was metabolized by N-debenzylation, N-dephenylation,
      oxidative deamination, ester hydrolysis and oxidation of 1, 4-dihydropyridine ring to its
      corresponding pyridine [L1457].

      oxidation reactions to the primary 4,5-dehydromoxonidine metabolite and a guanidine derivative
      by opening of the imidazoline ring. [FDA label]

      The antihypertensive effects of these 4,5-dehydromoxonidine and guanidine metabolites are only
      1/10 and 1/100 the effect of moxonidine [FDA Label].

      Oxidation on either the methyl group (pyrimidine ring) or on the imidazole ring of moxonidine
      results in the formation of the hydroxylmethyl moxonidine metabolite or the hydroxy moxonidine
      metabolite [A31315]. The hydroxy moxonidine metabolite can be further oxidized to the
      dihydroxy metabolite or it can lose water to form the dehydrogenated moxonidine metabolite,
      which itself can be further oxidized to form an N-oxide [A31315]. Aside from these Phase I
      metabolites, Phase II metabolism of moxonidine is also evident with the presence of a cysteine
      conjugate metabolite minus chlorine [A31315]. Nevertheless, the identification of the hydroxy
      moxonidine metabolite with a high level of dehydrogenated moxonidine metabolite in human urine
      samples suggests that dehydrogenation from the hydroxy metabolite to the dehydrogenated
      moxonidine metabolite represents the primary metabolic pathway in humans [A31315].

      The cytochromes P450 responsible for the metabolism of moxonidine in humans have not yet been
      determined [A31315].

      Ultimately, the parent moxonidine compound was observed to be the most abundant component in

      alafenamide presents significant plasma stability and hence, its activation is performed
      inside the target cells.[A178060]

      After activation, tenofovir is further processed and after 1-2 days, it is detected in plasma

      Tenofovir alafenamide is highly stable in plasma and, after administration of this prodrug,
      there is a low concentration of tenofovir in plasma. After oral administration, tenofovir
      alafenamide is rapidly absorbed by the gut. When a single dose is administered, a peak

      5-fluorodeoxyuridine-monophosphate and 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate.[L1557] More than 80% of
      the administered dose is eliminated due to the metabolism of dihydropyridine
      dehydrogenase.[A1821] Some other metabolic products include 3'-hydroxy tegafur, 4'-hydroxy
      tegafur and dihydro tegafur which all of them are significantly less cytotoxic than
      5-fluorouracil.[T122]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The absorption into systemic circulation is very rapid and the peak concentration is
      reached within 1-2 hours. After a single dose of tegafur/uracil of 300 mg/m2/day in three
      divided doses, tegafur plasma concentration of &gt;1000 ng/ml are maintained throughout the
      8-hour dosing interval, whereas uracil concentrations decline rapidly following the peak
      concentration. The plasma concentration of 5-fluorouracil peaks at 30-60 min after
      administration with 200 ng/ml and remain detectable for 8-hour dosing interval. There is no
      significant long-term accumulation of either uracil, tegafur or 5-fluorouracil.[L934]</absorption>

    <name>Vayarin</name>
    <metabolism>Phospholipids can break down into various substrates or remain intact and absorbed
      in the circulatory system and cross the blood brain barrier. Following dietary ingestion of
      PS, fatty acids esterified to the PS molecule are hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, forming
      lyso-PS and free fatty acids (FFA). After the lyso-PS is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, it
      can be re-acylated into PS, while partially converted into other phospholipids.
      Phosphatidylserine and other phospholipids formed inside the enterocytes can either be
      transported in the lymphatic circulation as chylomicrons or in the hepatic circulation, and
      enter the systemic circulation for distribution across the body. Current evidence shows that
      ingested phosphatidylserine reaches the systemic circulation and is incorporated into the
      phospholipids pool as phosphatidylethanolamine and other metabolites [L1506, L1510].

      The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism cycle begins with a series of desaturation,
      elongation and β-oxidation reactions. In a study of healthy volunteers and patients with
      hypertriglyceridemia, eicosapentaenoic acid, and DHA were absorbed when administered as ethyl
      esters orally. Omega-3-acids administered as ethyl esters (Vayarin) induced significant,
      dose-dependent increases in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid content, though increases
      in DHA content were less significant and not dose-dependent when administered as ethyl esters.
      Uptake of EPA and DHA into serum phospholipids in subjects treated with Vayarin was
      independent of age (&lt;49 years versus ≥49 years). Females were found to have more uptake of
      EPA into serum phospholipids than males [L1503].


      The effect of a mixture of free fatty acids (FFA), EPA/DHA and their FFA-albumin conjugate on
      cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase activities was assessed in human liver microsomes. At
      the 23 μM concentration, FFA resulted in a less than 32% inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19,
      2D6, 2E1, and 3A. At the 23 μM concentration, the FFA-albumin conjugate resulted in a less
      than 20% inhibition of CYP2A6, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A, with a 68% inhibition being seen for CYP2E1
      [L1503].

      In healthy volunteers and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), EPA and DHA were
      absorbed when administered as ethyl esters orally. Omega-3-acids administered as ethyl esters
      (Vayarin) induced significant, dose–dependent increases in serum phospholipid EPA content,
      though increases in DHA content were less marked and not dose-dependent when administered as
      ethyl esters. Uptake of EPA and DHA into serum phospholipids in subjects treated with Vayarin
      was independent of age (&lt;49 years vs. ≥49 years). Females tended to have more uptake of EPA
      into serum phospholipids than males. Pharmacokinetic data on Vayarin in children are not
      available [L1506, L1508].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Phosphatidylserine (the main component of this medical food) is an endogenous
      substance found in the human body. This medication is metabolized mainly in the intestines by
      decarboxylases in the mucosal cells [L1506]. The bioavailability of the ingested PS is poorly
      demonstrated to extensive metabolism in the intestine before absorption, and due to the fact
      that PS is transported and rapidly converted into other endogenous constituents [L1507].

      In one study, after oral administration of Vayarin to rats, most of the isotope label
      recovered from blood samples remained as the parent compound, PS, for up to 60 min after
      administration. After 24 h, metabolites were recovered from the blood, primarily as
      lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine. When radiolabeled PS was
      administered (orally or intraperitoneally) in animals, the radioactivity found in the urine
      was primarily metabolized (water soluble), whereas the 60-65% of fecal radioactivity was
      mainly associated with lipids. The major metabolite recovered in the feces was lysoPS after
      oral administration [L1507].</absorption>

    <name>Kappadione</name>
    <metabolism>Menadione or 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone is a synthetic vitamin K analog, undergoes
      1-electron reduction by enzymes such as microsomal NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase and
      mitochondrial NADH–ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), resulting in redox cycling, or it
      detoxification via two-electron reduction by NAD(P)H–quinone oxidoreductase [A32072].

      Vitamin K is a group of lipophilic, hydrophobic vitamins that exist naturally in two forms
      (and in 3 synthetic forms): vitamin K1, which is found in plants, and vitamin K2, which is
      synthesized by bacteria. Vitamin K is an important dietary component because it is necessary
      as a cofactor in the activation of vitamin K dependent proteins. Metabolism of vitamin K
      occurs mainly in the liver. In the first step, vitamin K is reduced to its quinone form by a
      quinone reductase such as NADPH dehydrogenase. Reduced vitamin K is the form required to
      convert vitamin K dependent protein precursors to their active states. It acts as a cofactor
      to the integral membrane enzyme vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase (along with water and
      carbon dioxide as co-substrates), which carboxylates glutamyl residues to
      gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues on certain proteins, activating them. Each converted
      glutamyl residue produces a molecule of vitamin K epoxide, and certain proteins may have more
      than one residue requiring carboxylation. To end the cycle, the vitamin K epoxide is returned
      to vitamin K via the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme, also an integral membrane protein.
      The vitamin K dependent proteins include various important coagulation factors, such as
      prothrombin. Warfarin and other coumarin drugs act as anticoagulants by blocking vitamin K
      epoxide reductase [L1568].

    <absorption>Menadiol sodium phosphate (vitamin K3), the synthetic analog of vitamin K, being
      water soluble, is advised in intestinal malabsorption or in states in which bile flow is

      however, this effect lasts for several days. The dose is 5–40 mg orally, daily. Menadiol
      sodium phosphate, even in moderate doses, may lead to hemolytic anemia and, for this reason,
      neonates should not receive this medication. This precautionary measure is valid especially
      those that are deficient in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD); their immature livers
      are unable to compensate for the heavy bilirubin load and there is an increased risk of
      kernicterus [L1563].

      xylose is first reduced to xylitol using the xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) enzyme with NADH or
      NADPH [A32666]. The resultant xylitol is subsequently oxidized to D-xylulose by the xylitol
      dehydrogenase (XDH) enzyme while utilizing the cofactor NAD [A32666]. Finally, the D-xylulose
      is phosphorylated by an ATP utilizing kinase (xylulose kinase enzyme) to generate
      D-xylulose-5-phosphate, which serves as an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway for
      nucleotide synthesis [A32666].</metabolism>

      regions. In contrast to air, the radiopharmaceutical does not normally enter the cerebral
      ventricles.
      Although the primary absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the blood stream occurs at
      the arachnoid villi, there is some evidence that a significant fraction of CSF is also
      absorbed across both the cerebral and spinal leptomeninges. Lesser quantities may also be

    <name>Polyethylene glycol 400</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of PEG involves the oxidation of the alcohol groups located on the
      PEG to a carboxylic acid. For example, the diacid and hydroxyl acid metabolites of PEG have
      been measured in the plasma and urine of burn patients and rabbits and in the bile of cats. In
      the isolated guinea pig liver and in rat/guinea pig in vitro, PEG has demonstrated to be
      sulfated. Evidence from experiments with PEG400 suggests that ethylene glycol is not formed as
      a metabolite of PEG in humans. Negligible amounts of oxalic acid are liberated after the
      metabolism of PEG [L1790].

      The first phase of metabolism of PEG in mammals is regulated by the enzyme alcohol
      dehydrogenase. Liver cytochorome P450 enzymes may also play a role in the oxidation of PEG,
      although the evidence for this is not clear [L1790]. Also, PEG has been shown to be
      metabolized by sulfotransferase enzymes. Although there is evidence that PEG can be
      metabolized to various phase 1 and phase 2 metabolites, the toxicology data presented above
      indicate that these metabolites are of very little toxicological concern. However, metabolism
      of PEG to the acid metabolite(s) has been implicated in the acidosis and hypercalcemia
      observed in patients after overdose [L1790]. It is clear that these metabolites can be formed
      in multiple toxicology species and that the phase 1 metabolites are seen in animals and
      humans. These data indicate that humans and animals will be exposed to similar metabolites
      after administration of PEG [L1790]. metabolic clearance of PEG decreases markedly as
      molecular weight increases. For PEG400, up to 25% of the dose may be metabolized in humans
      (Schaffer et al., 1950); similar results are also seen in the rabbit [L1790].

      The absorption of PEG by the oral route is molecular weight- dependent. Urinary recovery data
      for PEG400 indicate that 50 to 60% of PEG with this molecular weight is absorbed from the
      intestine [L1790]. In the case of PEG-400, up to 25% of the dose may be metabolized in humans.
      Similar results have also been obtained in studies on the rabbit [L1790].</metabolism>
    <absorption>PEG has low toxicity profile with an absorption of less than 0.5% [L1788].

      Topical absorption of PEG occurs and, demonstrates a molecular weight dependence similar to
      that of PEG given orally. Absorption by this route is likely to be poor [L1790].

    <metabolism>Nitrates are reduced to nitrites by the bacteria in saliva and the gastrointestinal

      months of age and during certain gastrointestinal tract infections, thereby favoring the
      reduction of nitrates [L1754].

      Nitrate is metabolized to a small extent. The biotransformation of potassium nitrate consists
      of nitrate reduction, nitrite formation, nitrite reoxidation to nitrate, and formation of
      methemoglobin or NO, in a dynamic equilibrium [L1752], [L1753], [L1754].</metabolism>

      consequence, psyllium remains predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract as a 'bulk' agent
      that passes largely unchanged throughout the gut [L1872]. The agent has remarkable water
      holding capacity because of its high hemicellulose content [L1872].

    <name>Allantoin</name>
    <metabolism>Uricase is the enzyme that possesses the functionality to convert uric acid to
      allantoin. Considering humans do not possess any endogenous uricase, uric acid is the only
      final breakdown product in the purine degradation of unwanted waste product purine nucleotides
      [L1834]. The presence of allantoin in human urine is subsequently the result of non-enzymatic
      processes on uric acid with reactive oxygen species [A32212]. Such non-enzymatic processes are
      consequently potentially suitable biomarkers for measuring oxidative stress in chronic
      illnesses and aging [A32212]. Furthermore, as allantoin is found endogenously and is part of
      basic, natural metabolic pathways, no accumulation is expected of it [FDA Label].
      Additionally, allantoin is not believed to be metabolized to a measurable extent in humans and
      animals [FDA Label].</metabolism>
    <absorption>In studies on human subjects, a recovery of 19% and 34% of allantoin in the urine
      was observed but only in two individuals and only after the administration of massive doses of
      allantoin [L1834]. After intravenous administration, recovery in the urine was practically
      quantitative with doses of 75 to 600 mgm in the human model [L1834]. After 240 mgm, excretion
      continued for 72 hours in human subjects and the results were similar in regards to

    <absorption>Percutaneous absorption is considered to be insignificant [L1814].

      In one study, benzalkonium chloride absorption was evaluated in women using tampons containing
      the agent. Venous blood samples were drawn 15 minutes before the tampon application and then
      again at 15 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 24 h after application. Benzalkonium chloride was not detected
      in any of the blood samples at any time tested. [L1814]

      Similarly, in another study, benzalkonium chloride absorption was tested in women using
      tampons containing the agent. Venous blood and breast milk samples were taken 15 minutes
      before application and 3 h and 24 h after tampon administration. Benzalkonium chloride was not
      found in any of the subjects' samples. [L1814].

      Moreover, in a study where benzalkonium chloride solution was placed on the corneal surface of
      rabbit subjects, at various intervals after administration, the rabbits' eyes would be washed
      with 1 mL saline and the following tissues and fluids were removed: bulbar and palpebral
      conjunctiva, aqueous humour, corneal epithelium, endothelium and stroma, iris-ciliary body,
      lens, vitreous, retina, and choroid. Plasma samples were obtained with direct cardiac
      punctures. After administration of one drop, benzalkonium chloride was found in the corneal
      epithelium, endothelium, and stroma, and in the bulbar and palpebral conjunctivae.
      Benzalkonium chloride loss from ocular tissues was such that about one-third to two thirds of
      its concentration (depending on the tissue) at 30 min remained after 24 hr; measurable values

    <metabolism>With in vivo models, eucalyptol or cineole (which make up to as much as 90% of most
      commonly used cineole-based eucalyptus oils), undergoes oxidation to form hydroxycineole which
      is excreted as glucuronide [L1854]. In rats, 2-hydroxycineole, 3-hydroxycineole, and
      1,8--dihydroxycineol-9-oic acid were identified as main urinary metabolites [L1854]. After
      oral administration to brushtail possums, p-cresol, 9-hydroxycineole, and Cineole-9-oic acid
      were found in urine [L1854]. Rabbits given eucalyptol by savage excreted 2-exo- and
      2-endo-hydroxycineole in the urine [L1854].

      The monterpene bicyclic ketone verbenone is a known component in eucalyptus globules [A32241].
      In one study, this component was observed to be converted to 10-hydroxyverbenone by rat and
      human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes, and indicated that CYP2A6 is a principal
      enzyme in verbenone hydroxylation in humans [A32241].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Common monoterpenoid compound preparations of eucalyptus oil have been observed to
      be readily absorbed after dermal application, likely due to their lipophilic character
      [A32235]. Although maximal plasma levels were demonstrated in as short a time period as 10
      minutes even with thicker preparations like eucalyptus oil ointments, like many other
      topically applied agents, the extent of absorption is also likely largely dependent upon
      additional factors like the size of treated skin area, patient skin condition(s),
      concentrations of the applied substance, and time of exposure to the substance [A32235].
      Currently, more data regarding the oral absorption of eucalyptus would be useful, given the
      relative lack of existing information [A32235]. Lipophilic monoterpene compound formulations
      of eucalyptus oil seems to be readily absorbed orally [A32236]. Regardless, there is some data
      that suggests that the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract has no particularly
      significant role in the absorption of cineole based eucalyptus oil [A32235].

      Pulmonary absorption of eucalyptus oil is also possible although little information exists
      regarding this element at the moment. Nevertheless, 1,8-cineol (which makes up to as much as
      90% of most commonly used cineole-based eucalyptus oils) [A32227] appears to be well absorbed
      via inhalation with peak plasma levels observed reportedly at 18 minutes [A32240].

      Given the three main constituents from Eucalyptus globulus Labill fruits, the intestinal
      absorption of macrocarpal A (M-A), macrocarpal B (M-B), and cypellocarpa C (Cy-C) is
      predominantly via passive diffusion while Cy-C demonstrates some partly ATP-dependent

    <name>Ammonia</name>
    <metabolism>Healthy hepatocytes detoxify ammonia where hepatic glutaminase, glutamine synthetase
      and the urea cycle enzymes act as major enzymes for ammonia metabolism. Ammonia is converted
      to urea in the liver and other tissues. Glutaminase and glutamine synthetase catalyze the
      condensation of ammonia with glutamate to glutamine, which is a common nontoxic carrier of
      ammonia [A32385]. In case of hepatic dysfunction or impairment, detoxification capacity
      decreases and may cause severe pathologies from hyperammonemia, such as hepatic encephalopathy
      [L2033]. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Ammonia can be absorbed via oral or inhalation route. Inhales ammonia is temporarily
      dissolved in the mucus of the upper respiratory tract, however the majority of the gas is
      released back into the air via expiration [L2033]. In healthy male subjects under exposure to
      500 ppm ammonia for 10-27 minutes, about 70-80% of total inspired ammonia was expired [L2033].
      In extrahepatic tissues such as the intestine, ammonia is incorporated into nontoxic glutamine

      administered substance was excreted via the kidney with almost complete elimination within 24
      hours [L1992]. The primary metabolites discovered in the excreted urine were glucuronides and
      sulfates [L1992]. Some chloroxylenol monographs liken its pharmacokinetic profile to that of
      another antiseptic - triclosan - which is rapidly excreted in the urine also as a glucuronide
      metabolite, as observed in the human model [L1992].

      Moreover, In one human subject administered 5 mg intragluteally, 14% was excreted with
      glucuronic acid and 17% with sulfuric acid at 3 days [A32350].

      Any chloroxylenol absorbed into the body is likely extensively metabolized by the liver and

      including selenomethionine, is metabolized to hydrogen selenide, and subsequently incorporated
      into essential selenoproteins [L1924].

      In vivo, selenium compounds are generally metabolized to reduced states. For example,
      quadrivalent selenium (Se+4) in selenite often undergoes reduction to Se−2, metabolized
      firstly to H2Se and, finally, being methylated to various excretory forms. Selenious acid to
      oxidize sulfurous acid: H2SeO3 + 2H2SO3 → Se0 + 2H2SO4 + H2O [L1912].

      Se may also produce reactive oxygen species and, thereby, exert cancer-selective cytotoxicity.
      Selenodiglutathione (SDG) is a primary Se metabolite conjugated to two glutathione (GSH)
      moieties. Selenodiglutathione increases intracellular selenium accumulation and is
      significantly more toxic than selenous acid (H2SeO3). [A32294].

      The liver is the central organ for selenium regulation and produces excretory selenium forms

      plasma [L1987]. Deletion of the gene for selenoprotein P in mouse models alters the

      any mutation in this kind of enzyme or coadministration with drugs that interfere with this
      enzyme may generate a change in the metabolism speed.[L1807] For years, because of this
      metabolism pathway, it was very hard to differentiate between illicit heroin users and
      involuntary exposure to poppy seeds. The original tests for this differentiations were based
      in the presence of morphine in urine without evidence of 6-monoacetylmorphine. Now it is known

      chromium [L1983]. The metabolites bind to cellular constituents [L1982]. </metabolism>
    <absorption>Chromium compounds are both absorbed by the lung and the gastrointestinal tract.
      Oral absorption of chromium compounds in humans can range between 0.5% and 10%, with the

      Absorption of chromium from the intestinal tract is low, ranging from less than 0.4% to 2.5%
      of the amount consumed [L1986]. Vitamin C and the vitamin B niacin is reported to enhance
      chromium absorption [L1986].

      Most hexavalent Cr (VI) undergoes partial intragastric reduction to Cr (III) upon absorption,

      readily penetrates cell membranes and chromium can be found in both erythrocytes and plasma

      have been studied in detail, an in-vitro study regarding the permeability of human skin to
      cresols demonstrated that cresols possess permeability coefficients larger than that of
      phenol, which is already known to be readily absorbed across the human skin [A32381]. In
      particular, the permeability coefficients (Kp) were approximated from the steady-state slopes
      of the relation between the cumulative amount of cresol isomer per unit area of membrane with
      time [A32381]. The particular Kp values calculated for m-, o-, and p-cresol were 2.54 x 10^-4,
      2.6 x 10^-4, and 2.92 x 10^-4 cm/minute, respectively [A32381].</absorption>

    <name>Barium sulfate</name>
    <metabolism>Barium sulfate is poorly water soluble and shows negligible levels of absorption
      from the gastrointestinal tract following both oral or rectal administration. In healthy
      subjects, orally administered barium sulfate is generally excreted within 24 hours. Rectally
      administered barium sulfate is eliminated with clearance of the enema [L1959].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Barium sulfate is not absorbed following oral or rectal administration with a normal
      gastrointestinal tract. In patients with a normal GI tract, barium sulfate is normally
      excreted within 24 hr after oral ingestion. Post rectal administration of barium sulfate
      suspensions, the drug is generally excreted when the enema is released. Some barium may remain
      in the colon for several weeks, however, and eventually clears, especially in patients with
      impaired intestinal peristalsis [L1957]. It is difficult to quantify the uptake of ingested
      barium because of a number of factors affect its absorption. The presence of sulfate in food
      can cause the precipitation of barium sulfate [L1957].

      The following is the approximate time to peak opacification of organs by barium sulfate in a
      healthy GI tract:

      Esophagus, stomach, and duodenum uptake of barium sulfate occurs almost immediately after oral
      administration [L1958].

      Small intestine uptake is dependent on gastric emptying rate and viscosity of the preparation;
      it may be delayed 15-90 minutes post ingestion [L1958].

      Small intestine (enteroclysis studies) uptake is immediate, following direct instillation
      [L1958].

      Colon and distal small intestine uptake are dependent on patient positioning. Hydrostatic
      pressure also determines the rate and degree of opacification [L1958].</absorption>

    <metabolism>Blood levels after parenteral injection are low and comparison of the radioactivity
      and chemical determinations suggest rapid metabolism of the Triclocarban [L2685].

      Human metabolism of TCC involves direct glucuronidation to form N- and N'- glucuronides as
      well as ring hydroxylation to 2'-hydroxy-TCC and 6-hydroxy-TCC, which are further metabolized
      to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. In human subjects given a single oral dose of TCC, 27%
      of the dose was excreted in the urine within 80 hours. About 70% of the administered dose was
      excreted in the feces within 5 days [L2685].

      The major urinary metabolites were N-glucuronides (average levels, 30 ng/mL) and a major
      plasma metabolite was the sulfate conjugate of 2'-OH-TCC (levels ranged from 0-20 ng/mL
      [L2685].

      The maximum plasma level occurred 2.8 hr after dosing and was 3.7 nmol-equivalents of TCC per
      g of plasma (approximately 1.2 ppm). Biotransformation of TCC was rapid but did not appear to
      involve splitting of the basic TCC structure. The major plasma metabolites were N- and
      N'-glucuronides of TCC which were eliminated with half-life approximately 2 hr to the urine
      and 2'-hydroxy-TCC sulfate and 6-hydroxy-TCC sulfate (the o-hydroxy-TCC sulfates) which were
      removed with half life approximately 20 hr (presumably into the bile) [L2685].</metabolism>
    <absorption>A human exposure study in a small group of subjects demonstrated that a portion of
      the TCC present in bar soaps is absorbed through the skin and is excreted in urine as
      N-glucuronides [A32932].

      Because they are produced and used in large quantities in various products, they are absorbed
      into the human body of the general population [L2679].

      The absorption of triclocarban during a human pharmacokinetic study was estimated at 0.6% of
      the 70 + or - 15 mg of triclocarban in the soap used. The triclocarban-N-glucuronide urine
      concentration varied considerably among the study subjects, and continuous daily use of the
      soap led to steady-state levels of excretion [L2685].

    <name>Tocopherol</name>
    <metabolism>Excess tocopherol is converted into their corresponding carboxyethylhydroxychroman
      (CEHC), based on the isomer of tocopherol.[A32448] More deeply, the metabolism of tocopherol
      begins with the hepatic metabolism which is led by a CYP4F2/CYP3A4-dependent ω-hydroxylation
      of the side chains which leads to the formation of 13'-carboxychromanol. The metabolic pathway
      is followed by five cycles of β-oxidation. The β-oxidation cycles function by shortening the
      side chains, the first cycle results in the formation of carboxydimethyldecylhydroxychromanol
      followed by carboxymethyloctylhydroxychromanol. These two metabolites are categorized as
      long-chain metabolites and they are not excreted in the urine. Some intermediate-chain
      metabolites that are products of two rounds of β-oxidation are
      carboxymethylhexylhydroxychromanol and carboxymethylbutylhydroxychromanol. These
      intermediate-chain metabolites can be found in human feces and urine. The catabolic
      end-product of tocopherols, as stated before, is CEHC which can be largely found in urine and
      feces.[A32451]

      Two new metabolites have been detected in human and mice feces. These new metabolites are
      12'-hydroxychromanol and 11'-hydroxychromanol. Because of their chemistry, it is thought that
      these metabolites can be the evidence for a ω-1 and ω-2 hydroxylation which leads to an
      impaired oxidation of 12'-OH followed side-chain truncation.[A32451]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The absorption of tocopherol in the digestive tract requires the presence of
      fat.[L2120] The bioavailability of tocopherols is highly dependent on the type of isomer that
      is administered where the alpha-tocopherol can present a bioavailability of 36%. This isomer
      specificity also determines the intestinal permeability in which the gamma-tocopherol presents
      a very low permeability. After oral administration, the C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; was
      1353.79 ng/ml for δ-tocopherol, 547.45 ng/ml for γ-tocopherol, 704.16 ng/ml for β-tocopherol,
      and 2754.36 ng/ml for α-tocopherol. The T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is three to four hours for
      δ-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, and β-tocopherol and about six hours for α-tocopherol.[A32447]</absorption>

      primary metabolites N,N-diethyl-m-hydroxymethylbenzamide (BALC) and Nethyl-m-toluamide (ET)
      [L2776]. Although several P450 isoenzymes have elicited activity in DEET metabolism, it
      appears that the CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 enzymes are the principal P450s responsible for the
      transformation of DEET to BALC and ET, respectively [L2776]. Most of the body load is
      metabolized by such hepatic P450 enzymes, with only 10%–14% recovered unchanged in the urine
      [A33060].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Most diethyltoluamide (DEET) formulations employ the agent as a liquid to be applied
      onto human skin in an effort to repel mosquitoes from feeding on the skin. Topical application
      and absorption is consequently the most common route of absorption. When used appropriately,
      DEET formulations are generally not indicated for too many other routes of absorption or
      administration, like parenterally or orally.

      DEET is absorbed quickly through intact skin; 48% of the applied dose is totally absorbed
      within 6 hours [L2775]. Topical absorption is the usual route of entry as DEET is normally
      applied to the skin as a mosquito repellent [L2775]. DEET applied to the skin has also been
      shown to accumulate in the dermis [L2775]. DEET is rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion
      [L2775]. Additionally, animal experiments demonstrate that DEET can cross the placenta
      [L2775].

      DEET is efficiently absorbed across the skin and by the gut [L2779]. Blood concentrations of
      about 3 mg/L have been reported several hours after dermal application in the prescribed
      fashion [L2779].

      Between 9% and 56% of dermally applied DEET is absorbed through the skin with peak blood
      levels being attained within 1 hour [L2775]. Absorption through the skin varies according to
      the site exposed to the DEET [L2775]. In animal model surfaces corresponding to the human
      palmar surface (an area that is typically heavily exposed during the application of liquid
      DEET), 68% of administered topical DEET was absorbed [L2775]. As a consequence, small children
      are at increased risk of excessive absorption of DEET applied to the skin because of their
      relatively higher surface to volume ratio compared to adults [L2775].</absorption>

      formation of complexes with various circulating endogenous plasma inhibitors (like
      antithrombin III) [L2079]. This rapid inactivation prevents the active agent from diffusing
      into the general circulation. The complexes formed are then generally cleared and eliminated

    <name>Evening primrose oil</name>
    <metabolism>The main component of evening primrose oil, [DB00132] is usually desaturated by
      delta-6-desaturase which transforms this fatty acid to [DB13854]. This metabolic activity
      usually is limited by external factors such as stress, aging, alcohol, smoking, inflammation,
      diabetes, etc. In presence of these circumstances, the linoleic acid gets accumulated in the
      body and it inhibits the activity of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase. In proper conditions,
      [DB13854] forms [DB00154] by the action of elongases and it can further act as a substrate for
      production of prostaglandins or to be denaturated to arachidonic acid.[T218]</metabolism>
    <absorption>The pharmacokinetics of evening primrose oil is mainly studied by analyzing its
      active ingredient [DB13854]. After administration, [DB13854] is rapidly absorbed and converted
      directly to [DB00154] and other precursors.[T218] When orally administered, the tmax was
      directly dependent to the time of administration, being of 2.7 hours in the evening and 4.4
      hours in the morning. The Cmax and AUC were registered to be approximately 21 mcg/ml and 274
      mcg.h/ml.[A32831] The bioavailability of [DB13854] acid is influenced by triglyceride
      composition, cellular kinetics of phospholipases and acyltransferases.[A33136]</absorption>

      individual metabolite was observed with an AUC greater than 10% of total radio-labeled
      material [FDA label].
      The main enzymes involved in the metabolism of isavuconazole are CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and

      _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ studies [FDA Label]. </metabolism>

    <name>Tocofersolan</name>
    <metabolism>The hydrolysis of tocofersolan occurs in the gut lumen. Tocofersolan is absorbed by
      cells, and the alpha-tocopherol moiety appears in chylomicrons in the lymph system in a manner
      that is identical to vitamin E absorbed from dietary sources. Cellular uptake does not require
      receptors, binding proteins or metabolic processes and does not occur by pinocytosis.
      Absorption of deuterated tocofersolan demonstrated a normal pattern in lipoproteins:
      alpha-tocopherol peaked first in chylomicrons, then peaked in very low- density lipoproteins
      (VLDL) and finally in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins
      (HDL)[L2371].</metabolism>
    <absorption>The bioavailability of vitamin E from tocofersolan is unique from than that of other
      medicinal products [L2371].

      Due to its amphipathic property in which it forms its own micelles, tocofersolan is readily
      taken up into enterocytes, even in the absence of bile salts; fat-soluble _d-alpha-tocopherol_
      is then released after hydrolysis. This formulation enhances the absorption of
      d-alpha-tocopherol compared to the administration of free d-alpha-tocopherol. Additionally,
      tocophersolan may enhance the absorption of water-insoluble agents and other fat-soluble
      vitamins [L2376].

      Tocofersolan is a pro-drug; the active metabolite is the _d-alpha-tocopherol_. At low
      concentrations, tocofersolan forms micelles which improve the absorption of non-polar lipids
      such as other fat-soluble vitamins. Its required micellar concentration is low (0.04 to 0.06
      mmol/l) [L2371].

      A pharmacokinetic study of 12 healthy subjects compared tocofersolan with a water-miscible
      reference vitamin E after one single oral loading dose of 1200 IU (international units). The
      relative bioavailability of tocofersolan was found to be (Frel of 1.01 ± 1.74) with AUC0-t of
      0.383 ± 0.203μM.h/mg, Cmax of 0.013 ± 0.006, Tmax of 6.0 h (6.0 – 24.0) [L2371].

    <name>Delamanid</name>
    <metabolism>Delamanid predominantly undergoes metabolism by albumin and to a lesser extent,
      CYP3A4. [L1407]. The metabolism of delamanid may also be mediated by hepatic CYP1A1, CYP2D6,
      and CYP2E1 to a lesser extent [31966]. Four major metabolites (M1–M4) have been identified in
      plasma in patients receiving delamanid where M1 and M3 accounts for 13%–18% of the total
      plasma exposure in humans [A31968]. While they do not retain significant pharmacological
      activity, they may still contribute to QT prolongation [A31967]. This is especially true for
      the main metabolite of delamanid, M1 (DM-6705) [A31966, A31967].

      Delamanid is predominantly metabolized by serum albumin to form M1 (DM-6705) via hydrolytic
      cleavage of the 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b] oxazole moiety. The formation of this major
      metabolite is suggested to be a crucial starting point in the metabolic pathway of delamanid
      [A31968]. M1 (DM-6705) can be further catalyzed by three pathways. In the first metabolic
      pathway, DM-6705 undergoes hydroxylation of the oxazole moiety to form M2 ((4RS,5S)-DM-6720),
      followed by CYP3A4-mediated oxidation of hydroxyl group and tautomerization of oxazole to an
      imino-ketone metabolite, M3 ((S)-DM-6718) [A31968]. The second metabolic pathway involves the
      hydrolysis and deamination of the oxazole amine to form M4 (DM-6704) followed by hydroxylation
      to M6 ((4R,5S)-DM-6721) and M7 ((4S,5S)-DM-6722) and oxidation of oxazole to another ketone
      metabolite, M8 ((S)-DM-6717) [A31968]. The third pathway involves the hydrolytic cleavage of
      the oxazole ring to form M5 (DM-6706) [A31968].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Following a single oral dose administration of 100 mg delamanid, the peak plasma
      concentration was 135 ng/mL [A31968]. Steady-state concentration is reached after 10-14 days
      [A31978]. Delamanid plasma exposure increases less than proportionally with increasing dose.
      In animal models (dog, rat, mouse), the oral bioavailability of delamanid was reported to be
      35%–60% [A31966]. The absolute oral bioavailability in humans is estimated to range from 25 to
      47% [A31967]. Oral bioavailability in humans is enhanced when administered with a standard
      meal, by about 2.7 fold compared to fasting conditions [L1407] because delamanid exhibits poor
      water solubility [A31967].</absorption>

    <metabolism>Amifampridine is extensively metabolized by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to
      3-N-acetyl-amifampridine, which is considered an
      inactive metabolite.[L43312]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Orally-administered amifampridine is rapidly absorbed in humans to reach the peak
      plasma concentrations within by 0.6 to 1.3 hours [F272]. A single oral dose of 20 mg
      amifampridine in fasted individuals resulted in mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) ranging
      from 16 to 137 ng/mL [F272]. Bioavailability is approximately 93-100% based on recoveries of
      unmetabolised amifampridine and a major 3-N-acetylated amifampridine metabolite in urine
      [F272]. Food consumption decreases amifampridine absorption and exposure with a decrease in
      the time to reach maximum concentrations (Tmax) [A33865]. It is approximated that food
      consumption lowers the Cmax on average by ~44% and lowers AUC by ~20%. based on geometric mean
      ratios [F272].

      Systemic exposure to amifampridine is affected by the overall metabolic acetylation activity
      of NAT enzymes and NAT2 genotype [A33881]. The NAT enzymes are highly polymorphic that results
      in variable slow acetylator (SA) and rapid acetylator (RA) phenotypes. Slow acetylators are
      more prone to increased systemic exposure to amifampridine, and may require higher doses for
      therapeutic efficacy [A33881, F272]. </absorption>

    <name>Pitolisant</name>
    <metabolism>Pitolisant is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 in
      the liver. The major non-conjugated metabolites are BP2.941 (piperidine N-oxide) and BP2.951
      (5-aminovaleric acid).[L1471] Metabolites can further undergo conjugation with glycine or
      glucuronic acid, and oxidation to a minimal extent.[L1476] Most metabolites of pitolisant do
      not retain considerable pharmacological activities.[L8063] Several conjugated metabolites were
      also identified; the major conjugated inactive metabolite was a glycine conjugate of the acid
      metabolite of O-dealkylated desaturated pitolisant and a glucuronide of a ketone metabolite of
      monohydroxy desaturated pitolisant.[L1471]

      Due to its extensive metabolism in the liver, the systemic exposure of pitolisant thus adverse
      events of the drug may be elevated in case of compromised liver function. The dosage
      adjustments for pitolisant is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.[L8063]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Pitolisant is rapidly and well absorbed following oral administration, resulting in
      the drug being 90% absorbed.[L8063] In healthy individuals receiving an oral dose of 20 mg,
      the Cmax was approximately 30 ng/mL.[A32025] Following oral administration of pitolisant 35.6
      mg once daily, the mean steady state Cmax and AUC were 73 ng/mL and 812 ngxhr/mL,
      respectively.[L8063] The Tmax was typically reached approximately 3 hours following
      administration.[L1471] Following repeated dosing, the steady-state plasma concentration is
      achieved after 5-6 days of administration but the inter-individual variability in the time to
      reach steady-state is reported to be high.[L1471] The absolute bioavailability of pitolisant

      rapid carboxyl ester hydrolysis by endogenous corneal esterases into latanoprost acid and
      butanediol mononitrate [FDA Label].

      After the latanoprost acid reaches the systemic circulation, it is largely metabolized by the

      [FDA Label].

      The butanediol monohidrate undergoes further metabolism (reduction) to 1,4-butanediol and
      nitric oxide (NO). Furthermore, this 1,4-butanediol metabolite is further oxidized to succinic
      acid that is subsequently then primarily taken up as a component in the tricarboxylic acid

      may also undergo intensive second metabolism in the liver where the major metabolites were
      glucuronides of tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin, with dihydroferulic acid and traces
      of ferulic acid as further metabolites [F114]. Hepatic metabolites are expected to be excreted

    <name>Selumetinib</name>
    <metabolism>Selumetinib is heavily metabolized in the liver and the proposed metabolic pathway
      is as follows [A193422]:

      Hydrolysis of selumetinib’s amide functional group produces M15 (AZ13326637), which contains a
      carboxylic acid.[A193422]

      Elimination of the ethanediol moiety from the parent compound results in the formation of the
      primary amide M14 (AZ12791138) metabolite.[A193422] Amide hydrolysis transforms M14 into M15,
      glucuronidation and further oxidation of M14 leads to M2, M6 and M1, and N-demethylation of
      M14 produces M12.[A193422]

      The amide glucuronide (M2) is thought to be the major circulating metabolite.[A193422]
      Demethylation of selumetinib produces the pharmacologically active M8 (AZ12442942), and
      further oxidation of M8 leads to M11.[A193422] Glucuronidation of M8 produces M3 or M5, and
      elimination of the ethanediol moiety from M8 results in a primary amide, producing
      M12.[A193422]

      Although the N-demethylated metabolite (M8) accounts for &lt;10% of the circulating
      metabolites, it is responsible for approximately 21-35% of any observed pharmacological
      activity.[A193422,L12852]

      Ribose conjugation transforms M12 into M9, while oxidation of M12 leads to M10 and M13
      metabolites.[A193422] Glucuronidation of M10 produces M1.[A193422]

      Direct glucuronidation of selumetinib produces M4 or M7, which can both eventually transform
      into M3 and M5 metabolites.[A193422]
    </metabolism>
    <absorption>Based on several studies investigating selumetinib at various doses in both
      pediatric and adult populations, the Tmax generally ranges between 1- 1.5
      hours.[A193536,A193422,L12852] In healthy adults, the mean absolute oral bioavailability was
      reported to be 62%.[L12852] Selumetinib should be administered on an empty stomach since food
      significantly decreases serum concentrations of the drug.[L12852]</absorption>

    <name>Vonoprazan</name>
    <metabolism>Vonoprazan is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, mainly CYP3A4,
      and to a lesser extent CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. Sulfo- and
      glucuronosyl-transferases also participate in the metabolism of vonoprazan, and all
      metabolites are pharmacologically inactive.[L41695,A253702] CYP3A4 converts vonoprazan into
      metabolites M-I and M-II, which are then converted to glucuronic-acid-conjugated products
      M-I-G and M-II-G, respectively.[A253707] Unlike proton pump inhibitors, the presence of
      CYP2C19 polymorphisms does not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of
      vonoprazan.[L41695]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Vonoprazan has time-independent pharmacokinetics, and steady-state concentrations
      are reached after 3 to 4 days. In patients given a single dose of vonoprazan, the
      AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-12h&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;
      were 154.8 ng*hr/mL, 25.2 ng/mL, and 2.5 h. In patients given vonoprazan twice daily, the

      were 272.5 ng*hr/mL, 37.8 ng/mL, and 3.0 h.[L41695] In patients given 10 mg to 40 mg of
      vonoprazan daily for 7 days, the AUC and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; increased in a
      dose-proportional manner. In healthy subjects given 20 mg of vonoprazan, a high-fat meal led
      to a 5% and 15% increase in C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and AUC; however, these changes were

    <metabolism>When absorbed, rifamycin is mainly metabolzied in hepatocytes and intestinal
      microsomes to a 25-deacetyl metabolite.[A39998]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Rifamycin has a very poor absorption[A39996] and thus, the generation of an oral
      modified-release formulation using the technology of the multi-matrix structure was required
      for the generation of the FDA approved product. This preparation allows the delivery of the
      active ingredient in the distal small bowel and colon without interfering with the flora in
      the upper gastrointestinal tract.[A39997]

      The multi-matrix is made by a lipophiic matrix surrounded in a hydrophilic matrix which allows
      for the protection of the active ingredient from dissolution in the intestinal aqueous fluids
      before it arrives in the cecum. All this matrix is surrounded by a gastro-resistant polymer
      that only desintegrate in a pH lower than 7.[A39998]

      All this administration-customed formulation allows for a bioavailability of &lt;0.1% and the
      plasma concentrations are reported to be of &lt;2 ng/ml in patients receiving a dose of 400
      mg. This confirms that the site of action of rifamycin stays in the small intestine and colon
      which prevents the need for dose adjustments in special populations as well as systemic drug
      interactions.[A39998]

      The reported Cmax, tmax, AUC and mean residence time after a dosage of 250 mg of rifamycin is
      36 mg/L, 5 min, 11.84 mg.h/L and 0.49 h respectively.[A39998]</absorption>

      ng/mL at steady state.[L8558] It is not considered active against NHE3.</metabolism>
    <absorption>Tenapanor undergoes very minimal systemic absorption following oral administration.
      During clinical trials, plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (i.e. less

    <name>Osilodrostat</name>
    <metabolism>Osilodrostat is extensively metabolized - approximately 80% of an orally
      administered dose is excreted as metabolites, and this is the predominant means of drug
      clearance.[L12132] The most abundant metabolites in plasma are M35.4 (di-oxygenated
      osilodrostat), M16.5, and M24.9 at 51%, 9%, and 7% of the administered dose,
      respectively.[L12132] The M34.5 and M24.9 metabolites have longer half-lives than the parent
      drug which may lead to accumulation with twice-daily dosing. Of the thirteen metabolites
      observed in the urine, the most abundant are M16.5 (osilodrostat glucuronide), M22 (a
      glucuronide conjugate of M34.5), and M24.9 at 17%, 13%, and 11% of the administered dose,

      urine, but its glucuronide conjugate (M22) accounts for approximately 13%.[L12132]

      The biotransformation of osilodrostat is mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) and
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, though no single enzyme appears to contribute
      &gt;25% to the total clearance.[L12123] Of the total clearance, approximately 26% is

      of M34.5, the major metabolite of osilodrostat, is likely non-CYP-mediated. The formation of

    <name>Isoflavone</name>
    <metabolism>The conversion of glycosylated isoflavones to de glycosylated isoflavones begins in
      the oral cavity, wherein oral microflora and oral epithelium exhibit β-glucosidase activity
      [A33103]. Further conversion is mediated by intestinal lactase phlorizin hydrolase on the
      luminal side of the intestinal brush border to form aglycones that diffuses into the
      enterocytes [A33103]. The glycosylated isoflavones may also be converted to aglycone in the
      large intestines by the resident intestinal microflora. Isoflavone aglycones that enter the
      intestinal cell via passive diffusion are rapidly conjugated into sulfate or glucuronide
      conjugates [A33103].

      Under the anaerobic, reductive conditions of the colon, genistein undergoes reduction to form
      dihydrogenistein and further to 5-hydroxyequol, while daidzein is reduced to dihydrodaidzein
      and equol [A33103]. Microbial cleavage of the Ring-C of isoflavones produces deoxybenzoin
      metabolites (DOBs), which retains similar biological activity as unchanged isoflavones and are
      passively absorbed [A33103]. There is a large interindividual variation in isoflavone
      metabolism, leading to circulating concentrations of isoflavone metabolites and parent
      isoflavones varying up to hundreds-fold [A33098]. About 25% of the non-Asian and 50% of the
      Asian population host the intestinal bacteria that convert the daidzein into the isoflavonoid
      equol, which is a beneficial isoflavonoid [A33098].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Following oral ingestion, serum isoflavone concentrations increase in a
      dose-dependent manner [A33098]. Isoflavones are metabolized by gut microflora, where they need
      to undergo deglycosylation in order to be absorbed in the intestine [A33103]. After oral
      ingestion, glycosylated isoflavones are rapidly deglycosylated, absorbed and metabolized in
      intestinal enterocytes and liver, entering the systemic circulation predominantly as
      conjugates with limited bioavailability [A33103]. In humans, the mean time to reach peak
      plasma concentrations (Tmax) for conjugated and unconjugated genistein and daidzein are
      approximately 5-6 and 6-8 hours, respectively [A33103]. </absorption>

      in blood by reversible disulfide exchange with endogenous thiols to predominantly form
      conjugates with serum albumin. Following a single radiolabeled dose of etelcalcetide in
      chronic kidney disease patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism requiring hemodialysis, the
      plasma exposure of biotransformation products is approximately 5-fold higher than that of
      etelcalcetide and their concentration-time course parallels that of etelcalcetide. </metabolism>
    <absorption>The pharmacokinetics of etelcalcetide is linear and does not change over time
      following single (5 to 60 mg) and multiple intravenous doses (2.5 to 20 mg) in chronic kidney
      disease patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism requiring hemodialysis. Etelcalcetide
      exhibited tri-exponential decay following intravenous administration. Based on population
      pharmacokinetic analysis, following three times a week intravenous dosing at the end of each
      3- to 6-hour hemodialysis session in chronic kidney disease patients, etelcalcetide plasma
      levels reached steady state in 7-8 weeks after dosing with a predicted accumulation ratio of
      3- to 4-fold</absorption>

    <name>Nicoboxil</name>
    <metabolism>Any systemically absorbed nicoboxil is expected to be hydrolyzed to nicotinic acid
      and 2-butoxyethanol in blood plasma [F12]. In vitro it is reported that such hydrolysis
      reactions are catalyzed by esterase-like activity of serum albumin and by plasma esterases
      [F12]. The nicotinic acid metabolite is also capable of vascular dilatation [F12]. In humans,
      the urinary elimination of 2-butoxyethanol's metabolite, 2-butoxyacetic acid was also reported
      [F12].

      The metabolism of nicoboxil is considered to be rapid [F12].

    </metabolism>
    <absorption>Specific investigations on absorption of dermally applied nicoboxil in laboratory
      animals or target species were not available [F12]. Published data for nicotinate esters
      related to nicoboxil indicated however, that members of this class of compounds are in
      principle able to penetrate skin [12].

      Regardless, there is interest in the studies that demonstrate nicoboxil and nonivamide
      combination topical applications as effective and safe analgesic products precisely because
      such topical formulations are expected to have much lower systemic absorption - and thus less
      exposure to systemic side effects (ie. like gastrointestinal upset, drowsiness, etc.) - than
      the oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, muscle relaxants, and steroids that
      may be more commonly prescribed over a rubefacient like nicoboxil [A32785, A32786].
      Nevertheless, despite the fact that topical nicoboxil and nonivamide products been available
      to use in some parts of Europe since the 1950s to treat discomfort of the muscuoskeletal
      system, the effects of nicoboxil and nonivamide have not been investigated in detail and a
      lack of detailed studies on nicoboxil pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics remains ongoing

      damaged skin is also reported to be low [A33138]. Absorbed silver ions are deposited into
      elastic and connective tissues throughout the body [L2853]. Biologically active silver ions
      mainly binds to intracellular proteins as inert complexes, and readily binds and precipitates

    <absorption>Absorption is dependent on many drug-related factors including: intrinsic properties
      of the steroid itself; concentration of the drug (increased concentration generally leads to
      more drug being absorbed but may plateau at higher concentrations); vehicle used (optimized or
      augmented vehicles &gt; ointments or gels &gt; creams or lotions); duration of exposure;
      frequency of application; combination with other products that break down the skin barrier and
      increase absorption (e.g., salicylic acid, urea). Patient-related factors that influence
      absorption include: patient age (infants and children absorb topical medications more quickly
      and to a greater degree than adults, and have a greater total skin surface to body weight
      ratio; the elderly have thinner skin and absorb drug more readily); disruption of the skin due
      to inflammation or disease (e.g., absorption increased in atopic dermatitis); total skin area
      treated; skin site treated (absorption is much greater from thin-skinned areas such as scalp,
      face, eyelid, axilla, and scrotum than from areas with thicker skin such as forearm, knee,
      elbow, palm and sole); absorption is increased with increased temperature or humidity of the
      skin or the environment; occlusion of the treated skin (via plastic wrap, oily vehicles,
      dressings, tape, diapers, tight-fitting clothing, etc.) can increase absorption up to 10-fold.

    <name>Omega-6 fatty acids</name>
    <metabolism>Most metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids occur in the liver but may occur in
      other tissues as well. Metabolism of omega-6 fatty acids leads to biosynthesis of eicosanoids,
      as mentioned above. Linoleic acid can be metabolized to other more unsaturated, long-chain
      members of the n-6 family by the insertion of additional double bonds during consecutive
      elongation and desaturation mechanisms. The initial rate limiting desaturation of LA to GLA is
      catalysed by the enzyme delta-6-desaturase (FADS2). Elongation then takes place to convert GLA
      to DGLA, by elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (ELOVL) 5, and finally a cycle of
      elongation and desaturation by delta-5-desaturase (FADS1) generates AA [A19374]. </metabolism>

      oral administration.
      Concentrations of plecanatide and its active metabolite in plasma are below the limit of
      quantitation after an oral dose of 3 mg. Therefore, standard pharmacokinetic parameters such
      as AUC, maximum concentration (Cmax), and half-life (t½) cannot be calculated. </absorption>

      phosphatylinositol-4,5-biphosphate which is a precursor of the second-messenger
      molecules.[T184] Inositol can be transformed to D-chiro-inositol via the actions of an

      oxidation of the 17-hydroxyl group. 4-Hydroxyestran-3,17-dione (M1) is formed by reduction of
      the A ring double bond along with the oxidation of the 17-hydroxyl group. Three isomeric
      compounds exist as another metabolite, as the 3α,4-dihydroxy-5α-estran-17-one,

    <name>Antihemophilic factor human</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of the human antihemophilic factor is identical to the normal
      inactivation and elimination pathway of the natural coagulation factor VIII. After activation,
      the human antihemophilic factor gets metabolized by activated protein C in R336 and R562 and
      this action inactivates this cofactor. The proteolysis generates two major fragments which are
      recognized by an anti-factor VIII A2 domain antibody. This process is followed by a further
      degradation into smaller fragments.[A31393]</metabolism>
    <absorption>After intravenous administration of the human antihemophilic factor the values of
      Cmax, AUC and Tmax were 100 IU/ml, 1450 IU h/ml and 0.43 h respectively. In a second clinical

      polypeptide chains bind in the deep active site groove of pepsin, and are then digested into
      smaller pieces. Following this, a variety of proteases and peptidases in the intestine

      absorbed by cells for use as metabolic energy or construction of new proteins [L2361].</metabolism>

    <name>Lipegfilgrastim</name>
    <metabolism>Lipegfilgrastim is metabolised via intra- or extracellular degradation by
      proteolytic enzymes [L2441]. Following binding to the G-CSF receptors, it is proposed to be
      internalized by neutrophils via a non-linear process, and then undergoes degradation within
      the cell by endogenous proteolytic enzymes. Alternatively, the linear pathway is likely due to
      extracellular protein degradation by neutrophil elastase and other plasma proteases [L2441]. </metabolism>
    <absorption>In studies of healthy volunteers receiving a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg
      of lipegfilgrastim, the peak plasma concentration of lipegfilgrastim was reached after a
      median of 30 to 36 hours [L2441]. Based on its molecular weight, lipegfilgrastim is believed
      to be primarily absorbed via the lymphatic system then drained into the vascular system
      [L2455]. Peak concentration and area under the curve, indicating full bioavailability, was
      lower in injection site of the thigh compared to subcutaneous injection in the abdomen and in
      the upper arm, with differences among the injection sites being the greatest in males compared

    <name>Perboric acid</name>
    <metabolism>If perboric acid or its sodium salt get in touch with body fluids, they will rapidly
      dissociate into hydrogen peroxide, carbonate and sodium ions which are naturally present in
      the body. The produced hydrogen peroxide is rapidly degraded in blood and tissues. As
      carbonate is part of the normal buffer system of the body it is unlikely to be absorbed in
      amounts that could disturb the normal balance of the body. The rest of the dissociation
      products are also not thought to produce any significant systemic modifications.[F67] </metabolism>

    <name>Ferrous sulfate anhydrous</name>
    <metabolism>The metabolism of iron is complex. Normally, iron exists in the ferrous (Fe2+) or
      ferric (Fe3+) state, but since Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+, which hydrolyzes to insoluble
      iron(III)hydroxides in neutral aqueous solutions, iron binds to plasma proteins and is either
      transported or stored throughout the body.[A32524]

      There are three proteins that serve to regulate the storage and transport of ingested iron.
      The first protein , transferrin, transports iron in both the plasma and extracellular fluid.
      Ceruloplasmin in the plasma and hephaestin on the enterocyte participate in the oxidation and
      binding of iron to transferrin. The main role of transferrin is the chelation of iron to
      prevent the production of reactive oxygen species, while facilitating its transport into
      cells.[L11794] The transferrin receptor, located on many cells that require iron, binds the
      transferrin complex and internalizes this complex. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron,
      making it readily available for body requirements.[A32524]

    </metabolism>
    <absorption>Approximately 5 – 10% of dietary iron is absorbed, and this absorption rate
      increases to up to 30% in iron deficiency states. Oral iron supplements are absorbed up to 60%
      via active and passive transport processes.[L2240] Gastrointestinal absorption of iron occurs
      via strict regulation by the enterocyte and duodenal cytochrome and ferric reductase
      enzymes.[A32524,L11794] The hormone hepcidin heavily regulates iron absorption and
      distribution throughout the body.[L11800]

      The median time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) is generally 4 hours after
      administration. Between 2-8 hours post administration, average serum iron concentrations
      fluctuate by 20%, according to one study.[A32500] Bioavailability of iron depends on whether
      it is administered in a film coated tablet or enteric coated tablet. One pharmacokinetic study
      in healthy volunteers revealed a 30% bioavailability for enteric coated tablets. The AUC of
      enteric coated tablets varied between a lower limit of -46.93 to 5.25 µmolxh/l. Cmax is higher
      for film coated tablets, ranging from 3.4 to 22.1 µmol/h/l.[A190933]

      It is advisable to take ferrous sulfate with ascorbic acid, as this practice may increase
      absorption.[L11800,L11794] Avoid antacids, tea, coffee,tea, dairy products, eggs, and
      whole-grain bread for at least an hour after taking ferrous sulfate. Calcium can decrease iron
      absorption by 33% if taken concomitantly.[L2240]</absorption>

      tissues, especially bronchial secretion, prostatic tissue, middle ear exudates and bone
      tissue. The tissue/serum ratio concentration is greater than 1 which indicates that this
      product does not stay long in the plasma. After oral administration of 600 mg of midecamycin,
      the peak serum concentration is 0.8 mg/L and it is attained 1 hour after oral administration.

      N-demethylation, and hydroxylation, followed by phase II sulfate and glucuronide conjugation.
      In the urine, the major metabolites were sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, while the major

      of its ester group although a negligible amount of hydrolysis may occur.

      In humans bioallethrin is metabolized primarily by CYP2C19 with some metabolism by CYP2C8,
      CYP3A4, and CYP2C9*2 [A32818]. The metabolites produced include primary alcohols via allylic

      the molecule, formation of a primary alcohol via allylic oxidation near the 5-membered ring or
      formation of an epoxide at this location and subsequent hydrolysis to a diol.

      containing Fc portions may also experience carbohydrate-specific uptake mechanisms associated
      with mononuclear phagocyte activity in the liver and other organs [A32480]. Additionally,

      and, finally, propionyl CoA.[A246594,L8932]

      Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways to form
      major active metabolites, estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[L35970]</metabolism>
    <absorption>Testosterone undecanoate is a lipophilic molecule that is absorbed into the
      intestinal lymphatic system after oral administration. It is then released into the general
      blood circulation by the thoracic duct, thereby bypassing the portal circulation and
      first-pass metabolism in the liver,[A246594,L41355] unlike endogenous testosterone.[A246614]

      Following intramuscular administration of 750 mg testosterone undecanoate, serum testosterone
      concentrations reached a maximum after a median of seven days (range of four to 42 days),

      ng/dL on the fourth day following injection of testosterone undecanoate. Steady-state serum

    <metabolism>Ferric cation is converted to ferrous iron by duodenal cytochrome B reductase.
      Ferritin may also convert ferric to ferrous iron [A32525].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Iron absorption and systemic iron homeostasis are regulated by hepcidin, which is a
      peptide hormone that also regulates the activity of the iron-efflux protein, ferroportin-1
      [A32514]. Iron is mostly absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum [L2258]. Fe3+ displays low
      solubility at the neutral pH of the intestine and is mainly be converted to ferrous iron
      (Fe2+) by ferric reductases [T28], as ferric salts are only half as well absorbed as ferrous
      salts [L2258]. Once converted in the intestinal lumen, Fe+2 is transported across the apical
      membrane of enterocytes [A32514]. The absorption rate of non-haem iron is 2-20% [A32514].
      Stored iron may be liberated via ferroportin-mediated efflux, which is coupled by reoxidation
      of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by ceruloplasmin in the serum or hephaestin in the enterocyte membrane
      [A32524]. Fe3+ subsequently binds to transferrin, which keeps ferric cation in a redox-inert
      state and delivers it into tissues [A32514].

      It is proposed that there may be separate cellular uptake pathways for ferrous iron and ferric
      iron. While ferrous iron is primarily carried by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMAT-1),
      cellular uptake of ferric iron is predominantly mediated by beta-3 integrin and mobilferrin,
      which is also referred to as calreticulin in some sources as a homologue [A32507]. However,
      the most dominant pathway in humans is unclear [A32507]. </absorption>

    <name>Fish oil</name>
    <metabolism>During and after absorption there are three main pathways for the metabolism of the

      incorporated into various categories of lipoproteins and then channeled to the peripheral
      lipid stores, or (b) the cell membrane phospholipids are replaced by lipoprotein phospholipids
      and the fatty acids can then act as precursors for various eicosanoids, or (c) the majority of
      the fatty acids are oxidised to meet energy requirements [F33, L2661]. The concentration of
      the EPA and DHA fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the plasma phospholipids corresponds to the
      EPA and DHA incorporated into the cell membranes [F33, L2661]. Ultimately, animal

    <name>alpha-Tocopherol acetate</name>
    <metabolism>Primary hepatic metabolism of alpha-tocopherol begins in the endoplasmic reticulum
      with CYP4F2/CYP3A4 dependent ω-hydroxylation of the aliphatic side-chain, which forms the
      13’-hydroxychromanol (13’-OH) metabolite [A32451]. Next, peroxisome ω-oxidation results in
      13’-carboxychromanol (13’-COOH) [A32451]. Following these two steps are five consecutive
      β-oxidation reactions which serve to shorten the alpha-tocopherol metabolite side-chains
      [A32451]. The first of these β-oxidations occurs still in the peroxisome environment,
      generating carboxydimethyldecylhydroxychromanol (CDMDHC, 11’-COOH) [A32451]. Then, in the
      mitochondrion, the second β-oxidation step forms the carboxymethyloctylhydroxychromanol
      (CDMOHC, 9’-COOH) metabolite [A32451]. Since both CDMDHC and CDMOHC possess a side-chain
      length of between 13 to 9 carbon units, they are considered long-chain metabolites. The
      hydrophobicity of these long-chain metabolites means they are not excreted in the urine but
      have been found in human microsomes, serum, and feces [A32451]. The next two β-oxidation
      reactions, still within the mitochondrion environment, produce two intermediate chain
      metabolites: carboxymethylhexylhydroxychromanol (CDMHHC, 7’-COOH), followed by
      carboxymethylbutylhydroxychromanol (CMBHC, 5’-COOH) [A32451]. Both of these intermediate chain
      metabolites are found in human plasma, feces, and urine [A32451]. Finally, the last
      mitochrondrion β-oxidation generates the catabolic end product of alpha-tocopherol metabolism:
      carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans (CEHC, 3'-COOH), which is considered a short-chain metabolite
      [A32451]. CEHC has been observed in human plasma, serum, urine, and feces [A32451].</metabolism>
    <absorption>When vitamin E is ingested, intestinal absorption plays a principal role in limiting
      its bioavailability [A32451]. It is known that vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that follows
      the intestinal absorption, hepatic metabolism, and cellular uptake processes of other
      lipophilic molecules and lipids [A32451]. The intestinal absorption of vitamin E consequently
      requires the presence of lipid-rich foods [A32451].

      In particular, stable alpha-tocopherol acetate undergoes hydrolysis by bile acid-dependant
      lipase in the pancreas or by an intestinal mucosal esterase [A32451]. Subsequent absorption in
      the duodenum occurs by way of transfer from emulsion fat globules to water-soluble multi- and
      unilamellar vesicles and mixed micelles made up of phospholipids and bile acids [A32451]. As
      the uptake of vitamin E into enterocytes is less efficient compared to other types of lipids,
      this could potentially explain the relatively low bioavailability of vitamin E [A32451].
      Alpha-tocopherol acetate itself is embedded in matrices where its hydrolysis and its uptake by
      intestinal cells are markedly less efficient than in mixed micelles [A32451]. Subsequently,
      the intestinal cellular uptake of vitamin E from mixed micelles follows in principle two
      different pathways across enterocytes: (a) via passive diffusion, and (b) via
      receptor-mediated transport with various cellular transports like scavenger receptor class B
      type 1, Niemann-Pick C1-like protein, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5/ABCG8, or
      ABCA1, among others [A32451].

      Vitamin E absorption from the intestinal lumen is dependent upon biliary and pancreatic
      secretions, micelle formation, uptake into enterocytes, and chylomicron secretion [T166].
      Defects at any step can lead to impaired absorption. [T166]. Chylomicron secretion is required
      for vitamin E absorption and is a particularly important factor for efficient absorption. All
      of the various vitamin E forms show similar apparent efficiencies of intestinal absorption and
      subsequent secretion in chylomicrons [T166]. During chylomicron catabolism, some vitamin E is
      distributed to all the circulating lipoproteins [T166].

      Chylomicron remnants, containing newly absorbed vitamin E, are then taken up by the liver
      [T166]. Vitamin E is secreted from the liver in very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Plasma
      vitamin E concentrations depend upon the secretion of vitamin E from the liver, and only one
      form of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, is ever preferentially resecreted by the liver [T166].
      The liver is consequently responsible for discriminating between tocopherols and the
      preferential plasma enrichment with alpha-tocopherol [T166]. In the liver, the
      alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) likely is in charge of the discriminatory
      function, where RRR- or d-alpha-tocopherol possesses the greatest affinity for alpha-TTP
      [T166].

      It is nevertheless believed that only a small amount of administered vitamin E is actually
      absorbed. In two individuals with gastric carcinoma and lymphatic leukemia, the respective
      fractional absorption in the lymphatics was only 21 and 29 percent of label from meals
      containing alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl acetate, respectively [T166].

      Additionally, after feeding three separate single doses of 125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg to a
      group of healthy males, the observed plasma peak concentrations (ng/mL) were 1822 +/- 48.24,
      1931.00 +/- 92.54, and 2188 +/- 147.61, respectively [L2268].</absorption>

    <name>Medical Cannabis</name>
    <metabolism>THC is primarily metabolized in the liver by microsomal hydroxylation and oxidation
      reactions catalyzed by Cytochrome P450 enzymes. 11-hydroxy-▵9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC)
      is the primary active metabolite, capable of producing psychological and behavioural effects,
      which is then metabolized into 11-nor-9-carboxy-▵ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH), THC's

    <absorption>Route of administration and formulation determine the rate of drug absorption.
      Smoking cannabis provides the most rapid route of absorption directly from lungs to brain
      (with THC levels reaching their peak within 3-10 minutes), while oral administration (with
      "edibles") is the slowest (with THC levels reaching their peak within 1-2 hours) [A32684]. In
      one study, maximum plasma concentration after oral administration, was found to be 4.4-11

      Following a single buccal administration, maximum plasma concentrations of both CBD and THC

      other cannabinoids are lower compared with inhalation of smoked cannabis. The resultant
      concentrations in the blood are lower than those obtained by inhaling the same dose because
      absorption is slower, redistribution into fatty tissues is rapid and additionally some of the
      THC undergoes hepatic first-pass metabolism to 11-OH-THC, a psycho-active metabolite. </absorption>

      Netupitant is a moderate inhibitor and substrate of CYP3A4 [FDA label].

      Akynzeo should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant medications that are
      primarily metabolized through CYP3A4 systems. One dose of netupitant 300 mg significantly
      inhibits CYP3A4 for about 6 days. It is avisable to avoid concomitant use of drugs that are
      CYP3A4 substrates for one week. If not possible, consider dose reduction of CYP3A4 substrates
      [FDA label].

      In the human, rat, dog, minipig and marmoset liver microsomal incubations, two major
      metabolites, an _N-demethylation product (M1) _and an _N-oxidation product (M2)_, in addition
      to hydroxylation products (M3), were identified in all species. CYP3A4 was found to be
      responsible for the oxidation of netupitant to the same metabolites observed also in the
      incubations with human liver microsomes. Metabolism was extensive, with the metabolites
      generally achieving greater concentrations than parent drug witin 24 hours. M1 and M2 exposure
      was similar in rat to humans, but higher in dogs, however M3 was lower in both species than in

      Oral bioavailability in each species varied substantially between animals, with 42-105%,
      34-83% and 37-62% in rats, dogs, and monkeys. The large variation is most likely due to the

      negative charge limits its cellular penetration, and its passive diffusion across cellular
      membranes and intestinal mucosa hindering its availability for oral administration.[A178060]

      or water-mediated hydrolysis, to form aripiprazole, which mainly contributes to the
      pharmacological actions of aripiprazole lauroxil. Aripiprazole is further metabolized by
      hepatic CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 to form dehydro-aripiprazole, which retains some pharmacological
      activity. Dehydro-aripiprazole displays affinities for D2 receptors similar to aripiprazole
      and represents 30-40% of the aripiprazole exposure in plasma [FDA Label]. Cytochrome P450 2D6

    <name>Zinc acetate</name>
    <metabolism>Zinc is released from food as free ions during its digestion. These freed ions may
      then combine with endogenously secreted ligands before their transport into the enterocytes in
      the duodenum and jejunum. [L2092]. Selected transport proteins may facilitate the passage of
      zinc across the cell membrane into the hepatic circulation. With high intake, zinc may also be
      absorbed through a passive paracellular route [L2092].

      The portal system carries absorbed zinc directly into the hepatic circulation, and then it is
      released into systemic circulation for delivery to various tissues. Although, serum zinc
      represents only 0.1% of the whole body zinc, the circulating zinc turns over rapidly to meet
      tissue needs [L2092].</metabolism>
    <absorption>Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine by a carrier-mediated mechanism [L2092].
      Under regular physiologic conditions, transport processes of uptake do not saturate. The exact
      amount of zinc absorbed is difficult to determine because zinc is secreted into the gut. Zinc
      administered in aqueous solutions to fasting subjects is absorbed quite efficiently (at a rate
      of 60-70%), however, absorption from solid diets is less efficient and varies greatly,
      dependent on zinc content and diet composition [L2092].

      Generally, 33% is considered to be the average zinc absorption in humans [L2092]. More recent
      studies have determined different absorption rates for various populations based on their type
      of diet and phytate to zinc molar ratio. Zinc absorption is concentration-dependent and
      increases linearly with dietary zinc up to a maximum rate [L2092].

      Additionally zinc status may influence zinc absorption. Zinc-deprived humans absorb this
      element with increased efficiency, whereas humans on a high-zinc diet show a reduced
      efficiency of absorption [L2092].</absorption>

      of the cyclic anhydride to yield the detectable alanine metabolite (GS-704277).[A222468] The

      dimethyl fumarate, in the liver.[A187544] These enzymes are present in high quantities in the
      gastrointestinal tract, tissues, and blood. Esterase metabolism of this drug produces the

      with small amounts of methanol, and another inactive metabolite, RDC-8439.[A187532,L9623]
      Following esterase metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)cycle further metabolizes MMF. The
      major metabolites of MMF in plasma include fumaric acid, citric acid, and
      glucose.[A187544,L9623] It is important that methanol is a major metabolite of dimethyl

      The average steady state concentration of this metabolite is estimated at 8.32 mg.hr/L after
      it is administered twice a day in patients with MS.[L9623] The mean AUC0–∞ of the active
